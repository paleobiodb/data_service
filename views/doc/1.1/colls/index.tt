=head2 DESCRIPTION

The URL paths documented in this section provide access to information about
the fossil collections represented in the Paleobiology Database.  In the
context of our database, a "fossil collection" represents a set of fossil
occurrences co-located geographically and temporally.  In order to belong to a single
collection the occurrences must have been collected deliberately as a group,
though not necessarily all on the same occasion.

Using the paths described here, you may query for collections by a variety of
criteria including: name, location, age, enterer, and taxonomic identification.
Examples are given below.

=head3 Geographic clustering

In order to facilitate efficient mapping of the worldwide fossil record as
represented in this database, we have added to the database several levels of
geographic clusters.  Each cluster represents the aggregate of all the fossil
collections in a particular area of the globe, and can be used to generate
maps at low resolutions.

You can query for these clusters using the
L<summary|/data1.1/colls/summary_doc.html> URL path as indicated below.  The
L<config|/data1.1/config_doc.html> URL path may be used to get information
about the levels of clustering defined in the database.

=head2 SYNOPSIS

The following URL paths are available:

=over 4

=for pp_table_header Class* | Documentation | Description

=item Single collections | L</data1.1/colls/single|/data1.1/colls/single_doc.html>

Returns information about a single collection, selected by identifier.  For example:

=over 4

=item *

L</data1.1/colls/single.json?id=50068&show=loc,time>

=back

=item Lists of collections | L</data1.1/colls/list|/data1.1/colls/list_doc.html>

Returns information about multiple collections, selected according to the parameters
you provide.

Examples:

=over 4

=item *

L</data1.1/colls/list.txt?base_name=Cetacea&interval=Miocene&show=ref,loc,time>

=item References | L</data1.1/colls/refs>

Returns information about the bibliographic references associated with collections,
selected according to the parameters you provide.  For example:

=over

=item *

L</data1.1/colls/refs.ris?lngmin=0&lngmax=15&latmin=0&latmax=15&textresult>

=back

=item Summary clusters | L</data1.1/colls/summary|/data1.1/colls/summary_doc.html>

Returns information about geographic clusters of collections, selected according
to the parameters you provide.  Examples:
