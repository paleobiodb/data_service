=head2 DESCRIPTION

This page describes the text response formats in detail.

=head2 SYNOPSIS

This service can produce responses in two different text formats: tab-separated and comma-separated.  Both
of these formats use the classic PBDB field names by default, which means that you can do the same things
with them that you have been able to do with PBDB download files.  The main differences are these:

=over

=item *

The responses may include some new fields which were not present in the PBDB Classic downloads.

=item *

The columns may not appear in the same order as in the old download files.

=item *

Depending upon the parameters you supply, some optional header material may be included.

=item *

The text is encoded in UTF-8, rather than ISO-8859-1 as was the case with PBDB Classic.

=back

You may choose from any of the following three suffixes:

=over

=for pp_table_header Suffix | Description

=item C<.csv>

Generate a download file in comma-separated text format.  Most browsers will save this
file directly to disk; if you would rather see it immediately in a browser tab, then either use
the suffix C<.txt> instead or include the parameter L<textresult|/data1.1/common>.

=item C<.tsv>

Generate a download file in tab-separated text format.  If you wish to see the result in
a browser tab instead, include the parameter L<textresult|/data1.1/common>.

=item C<.txt>

Display the results in a browser tab in comma-separated text format.
You will then be able to save this file to disk using the "Save Page As..." 
menu item in your browser, which will produce the same result
as if you had used the C<csv> suffix.

=back

Note that you should only use the C<textresult> parameter or C<.txt>
suffix if your result set is of small to moderate size.  If you try to
display a large result set directly in a browser tab, it may take a
long time to render and use up an enormous amount of memory.

In addition, you may choose to include one or more of the following URL parameters:

=over

=for pp_table_header Parameter* | Description

=item noheader

If this parameter is specified, then no header material at all will be included.  The first line of the file
will be the first data record, if any.  If no data records were found, the file will be empty.  This parameter
doesn't need any value.

=item linebreak

If this parameter is given a value of C<cr>, then each line will be terminated by a single carriage return
character instead of the standard carriage return/line feed sequence.

=back

The body of the response consists of a series of lines containing comma-separated or tab-separated values.
The initial part of the file may contain some or all of the following lines:

=over

=for pp_table_header Label | Description

=item C<Data Source:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<showsource|/data1.1/common> was specified.
The value in the second column will be the name of this data source.

=item C<Data Source URL:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<showsource|/data1.1/common> was specified.
The value in the second column will be the base URL for this data source.

=item C<Data License:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<showsource|/data1.1/common> was specified.
The value in the second column will be the license under which this data is provided.

=item C<Data License URL:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<showsource|/data1.1/common> was specified.
The value in the second column will be a URL from which the terms of the license
may be fetched.

=item C<Documentation URL:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<showsource|/data1.1/common> was specified.
The value in the second column will be a URL that provides documentation about the URL path
used to fetch this data.  This URL will document both the parameters and the response fields.
This information may be helpful in guiding the later interpretation of this data.

=item C<Data URL:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<showsource|/data1.1/common> was specified.
The value in the second column will be the actual URL that was used to fetch this data.
If this dataset is saved to disk, the included line will allow someone to later repeat this query.

=item C<Access Time:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<showsource|/data1.1/common> was specified.
The value in the second column will be the date and time time (GMT) at which this data
was accessed.  If this dataset is saved to disk, the included line will enable it to be
compared with other datasets on the basis of access time.

=item C<Parameters:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<showsource|/data1.1/common> was specified.  It will
be followed by one line per parameter, giving the parameter name and value(s) used to generate this 
result.  If this dataset is saved to disk, the parameter information may be helpful in documenting how
the data was selected, what it includes, and what it does not include.

=item C<Records Found:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<count|/data1.1/common> was specified.  The 
value in the second column will be the number of records that matched the main query.

=item C<Records Returned:>

This line will be present if the paramter L<count|/data1.1/common> was specified.  The value
in the second column will be the number of records actually returned.  This may be less than
the total number of records found, because the size of the result set is
limited by default to 500.  You can override this using the L<limit|/data1.1/common>
parameter.

=item C<Record Offset:>

This line will be present if the parameter L<count|/data1.1/common> was specified, and if
the parameter L<offset|/data1.1/common> was specified with a value greater than zero.  The
value in the second column will be the number of records that were skipped at the beginning
of the result set.

=item C<Warning:>

One or more of these lines will be present if any warnings were generated during the execution
of the query.  The warning message(s) will appear in the second column.

=item C<Records:>

If any of the lines mentioned so far in this table appear in the output, this line will appear immediately
before the data header line.  It serves to mark off the supplementary header material from the data.

=item I<data header>

Unless the parameter L<noheader|/data1.1/common> was specified, a data header line will always precede
the first data line.  This header line will contain the name of each column.

=back

The data records will follow this header material, one record per line until the end of the file.

For example, the following URL will produce the following output, looking very similar to a PBDB Classic download:

=over

=item *

L</data1.1/occs/list.txt?base_name=Dascillidae&limit=5>

=back

By contrast, the following URL includes some additional header information, terminated by a "Records:" line.

=over

=item *

L</data1.1/occs/list.txt?base_name=Dascillidae&showsource&count&limit=5>

This output includes several header lines, terminated by the "Records:" line.  Following that is the data header, and then the data records.

Lastly, the following URL generates just the data records with no header information at all:

=over

=item *

L</data1.1/occs/list.txt?base_name=Dascillidae&noheader&limit=5>

=back
