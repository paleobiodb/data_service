<h3>General comments</h3>
</center><p>

<p><b>WARNING:</b> Do NOT use the taxonomy scripts unless you understand all of the terms listed in the four "what the terms mean" sections on this page</a>.</p>

Currently, we do not handle phylogenetic data and put all the other information into just two tables. The <b>authority table</b> lists all taxa we know about, who named them, and when.
The <b>opinion table</b> lists all classification, synonymy, and validity information, giving the authority and year for each opinion. Taxa can appear only once in the authority table but many times in the opinion table.<p>

<p>You will use two different scripts to enter data into these two tables.
Follow the "Add/edit taxonomic names" link on the main menu to enter authority data.
Follow the "Add/edit taxonomic opinions" link on the main menu to enter classification, synonymy, and validity data.</p>

Our main goal is to correct names used in other tables, especially identifications in taxonomic lists associated with fossil collections. To do this, we need to make sure that every species is used in combination only with one genus in any one data analysis, and that every genus is allocated to a higher taxon we can use in our analyses.<p>

If only one synonymy/combination gets used at a time, then who cares about all the other stuff? Why do we keep track of every opinion ever published on every name? There are several reasons:<p>

<ul>
<li>Taxonomists need the details to do their job. Without the whole taxonomic history of a name, it can be difficult or impossible to decide which opinion is most reasonable.
<li>Taxonomic history can tell us about our sampling of biological diversity. We can roughly estimate how many species are left to be discovered by comparing the cumulative amount of taxonomic activity to the cumulative number of known species through historical time.
<li>Taxonomic history tells us about the quality of taxonomy. Rates of synonymization may vary among groups, among geological intervals, or through historical time, indicating where there needs to be more study and whether we can trust certain data sets.
</ul>

<hr>
<center>
<a name="Authority"></a>
<h3>Authority form: Who named the taxon?</a></h3>
</center><p>

<p>IMPORTANT: At this point the name of the taxon must be correct.</p>

<ol>
<li> Be very sure you have the spelling right. If not, quit and start over.
<li> Don't use the spelling or combination given by the current reference if the original name is different.
Make sure you put in the original name instead.
</ol>

<p>Every taxon has to be named in a publication, which is called the authority. For example, <i>Homo sapiens</i> was named in a 1758 publication by Linnaeus, so the authority is <i>Linnaeus 1758</i>.
You can record the authority in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li> You are entering data from the same paper in which the taxon was named. So, if you are reading Linnaeus 1758, select the radio button that says "It was first named in the data record's primary reference."
<li> You are working from another, later paper that discusses the species and gives some information about the authority. So, select the button that says "it was named in an earlier publication" and enter as much as you can about the author names and the year the taxon was named.
</ol>

<p>Some rules on creating taxa:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never create more than one authority record for a taxon, even if the original record is owned by some other authorizer and/or entered by some other enterer; the original record mistakenly has different names of authors, dates of publication, etc.; or if you are about to classify the taxon in a new way.
But <i>do</i> create a new record if the taxon is actually biologically different even though its name is spelt the same way (i.e., it has a different type specimen or type taxon).
This can happen when names are homonyms (see definitions of opinion terms below).
<li>Create a new authority record for any taxon name that is spelt differently.
So, if Linnaeus named the family "Equidae" but someone later created a subfamily called "Equinae," or reranked "Equidae" as the subfamily "Equinae," then Linnaeus is the author of that name too, a new authority record will be needed for that new spelling and rank combination. The script will automatically create one for you when you enter the new classification.
<li>DO NOT enter common English names such as "antelope", "oyster," or "conifer" as new taxa.
These terms always can be translated into formal scientific names such as "Bovidae," so they should not be entered anywhere in the Database.
<li>Likewise, never create an authority record for an informal but still scientific name such as a leaf type category.
<li>And don't create a record for an "indeterminate" higher taxon that includes an "incertae sedis" taxon.
Instead, "incertae sedis" taxa should be classified into the next higher-ranked taxon that <i>is</i> formally defined.
So if all you know is that the genus is a plant, put in the opinion that it belongs to "Plantae."
</ul>


<center>
<h4>What the terms mean</h4>
</center><p>

<ul>
 <li>"<i>primary reference</i>" means the reference that told you who named the taxon, regardless of whether the taxon was named in that paper.
The primary reference is the "current reference" you are using when you create the record in the first place.
If you are adding more data for a name that previously was entered, (1) the primary reference may be different from your current reference, and (2) the primary reference radio button will be checked <i>and</i> the reference information will be displayed.
The scripts won't be confused by these facts, so don't worry about them.
 <li>"<i>pages</i>" means the page number, or numbers, on which the taxon was named.
DON'T enter page numbers for the whole paper!
Usually the first page of the formal definition is good enough.
You don't need to include "p." or "pp." or "page" or "pages" in the field; just enter the number(s).
 <li>"<i>figures</i>" means a list of figure numbers that show the type specimen.
If there are both figures and plates, enter the numbers like this: "1, 2, Pl. 3" instead of "Fig. 1, 2, Pl. 3."
</ul>

<hr>
<center>
<a name="Type"></a>
<h3>Authority form: How was it named?</h3>
</center><p>

In this section you record key data about the taxon that should have been published when the name was first described.<p>

<b>Original rank</b><br>
The Linnean taxonomic rank of the taxon that is being discussed, as it was originally published by the original author.<p>

<ul>
<li>If someone changed the rank and the spelling changed (e.g., "Herpestinae" changed to "Herpestidae"), enter the new name and rank in the "How was it spelled section" and a new authority record based off the original spelling will be created for you and linked to the original, if need be.  
<li>Use the "unranked clade" value if the original author does not use ranks but does use formal Latin names for higher taxa.
Also use this term for non-standard ranks such as "Mirorder" or "Parvorder."
<li>You may <i>not</i> define genera or species as "unranked clades"; this term only applies to higher taxa.
</ul>

<b>Comments</b><br>
Note any problems here. For example, make a note if: you are not sure you have the taxon's authority right; different sources say the taxon was named in different years; a technical error was made by the authority, such as not designating or figuring a type specimen; or the type specimen's fossil collection cannot be recorded because the type locality data are inadequate.<p>

<center>
<h4>What the terms mean</h4>
</center><p>

<ul>
 <li>"<i>original rank</i>" means the rank in the Linnean hierarchy that was given to the taxon when it was first named.
 <li>"<i>type taxon</i>" means the taxon at the next lower rank that is the name-bearer.
So, if <i>Equus caballus</i> is the type species of the genus <i>Equus,</i> then <i>Equus</i> must always include <i>E. caballus</i>, and if <i>E. caballus</i> is moved to another genus, then <i>Equus</i> becomes invalid.
 <li>"<i>type specimen</i>" means the museum number of the actual physical specimen that is the name-bearer of a species.
If a set of specimens that form a biological species (the "hypodigm") includes a type specimen, that species must have the name associated with that specimen.
If there are two type specimens in a biological species, the names are synonyms (see below).
</ul>

<hr>
<center>
<a name="Status"></a>
<h3>Opinion form: Whose opinion are you entering?</h3>
</center>

<p>Every opinion has to be tied to a reference. If the opinion is based on what you read in your current reference, check the "current reference" box. If not, enter as much information as you can about the earlier publication that argued this opinion. For example, if the current paper says "Xus was synonymized with Yus by Jones 1984" but says nothing more about the status of Xus, enter "Jones" and "1984" in this section and don't check the box.</p>

<p>It is important to enter a new opinion every time a paper publishes any opinion on a name.
Do this anyway even if the opinion is not novel (someone else said it first, even if it's the same person).
Always enter the author's own opinion, but also enter other opinions that the author is repeating from the literature, as long as we have no other version of that opinion in the Database.
For example, suppose that Linnaeus classifed <i>Equus</i> as belonging to "Equidae" in 1758.
Nobody working on the Database actually has a copy of Linnaeus, but your current reference says that Linnaeus said what he said.
So, create an opinion record where "the opinion is repeated from an earlier authority" and you put "Linnaeus 1758" in the first author last name and publication year fields.
Only do this once, so if yet another paper mentions Linnaeus' opinion, do NOT create a new opinion record.</p>

<center>
<h4>What the terms mean</h4>
</center><p>

<ul>
 <li>"<i>pages</i>" means the page, or pages, on which the opinion is expressed.
This field is optional and is just meant to help someone find the opinion if they want to read the paper.
 <li>"<i>figures</i>" means the page or pages or plate numbers where specimens of the species are illustrated.
Again, this is for informational purposes only.
</ul>

<hr>
<center>
<a name="Opinions"></a>
<h3>Opinion form: What did they say about its status?</h3>
</center>

<p>Once a taxon is named, the classification or validity of that taxon are a matter of opinion.
Your job is to pick <i>one</i> opinion that best represents the author's viewpoint, or the viewpoint of the earlier publication that the author has mentioned.
It is <i>very</i> important to record opinion data if at all possible.
Otherwise we can't perform data analyses that require (say) finding all the taxa in a taxonomic group, or catching all the synonyms in the taxonomic occurrence lists so they can be reidentified.
Read this entire section carefully, including the "How to read a synonymy list" discussion below, before you do anything.</p>

<p>The scripts will display opinion information whenever you are entering new taxonomic data, or after you are done entering the data.
You also can see the data by using our script for displaying taxonomic information.
Click "Search for a taxon" on the main menu, find the taxon, check off "taxonomic history" and "synonymy," and update.
All the opinion data you entered should be visible.</p>

<p>Note that you may also enter the numbers of the pages and figures where the taxon is discussed in the paper whose opinion you are recording.
DON'T enter page numbers for the whole paper!</p>


<center>
<h4>What the terms mean</h4>
</center><p>

Information about how the taxon was both spelled and classified must be entered. 

<p><b>Classification</b></p>

There are three major types of classification:<p>

<i>Valid.</i> The taxon is valid, so classify it. First pick the "Valid" radio button and then enter the name of the higher taxon (for a genus, this is a family; for a species, this is a genus).
<i>Important:</i> you also may enter the verbatim text of the formal diagnosis, if one is given.
The database stores different values depending on whether the taxon is a species:
 <ul>
 <li>"<i>belongs to</i>" means a <u>higher taxon</u> (not a species) is valid and falls within an even higher parent taxon. A subgenus belongs to a genus; a genus belongs to a tribe, subfamily, family, or (if hard to classify) some even higher taxon; etc. Remember, lower belongs to higher - a genus belongs to a family,
 not the other way around!
</ul>

<p><i>Synonymy.</i> The taxon is invalid and the same as something else.
Pick "Invalid and another name should be used," pick the status, and then enter the other name.
The possible status values are:
<ul>
 <li>"<i>subjective synonym of</i>" means that the taxon is invalid because the same taxon was given a different name by an earlier author (although the types are different). List the older, valid name (i.e., the senior synonym) in the parent taxon field.
 <li>"<i>objective synonym of</i>" means that the taxon is invalid because <i>exactly the same</i> type specimen was used by an earlier author as the basis of a different name. List the older, valid name in the parent taxon field.
 <li>"<i>homonym of</i>" means that the taxon is invalid because another taxon with exactly the same name has priority over it. List the older, valid name in the parent taxon field.
 <li>"<i>replaced by</i>" means that the taxon is a homonym and has been replaced by a new name. List the younger, valid replacement in the parent taxon field.
 </ul>
 
<p><i>Invalid. </i> The taxon is invalid and you can't even tell if it's the same as something else.
Pick "Invalid and no other name can be applied" and then choose the status. The values are:
<ul>
 <li>"<i>nomen dubium</i>" means that the taxon is probably invalid and needs to be investigated. Leave "parent taxon" empty.
 <li>"<i>nomen nudum</i>" means that the original description didn't follow the rules of nomenclature properly, so the name has no scientific meaning. Leave "parent taxon" empty.
 <li>"<i>nomen oblitum</i>" means that the name has gone unused for many decades and is being set aside for purposes of synonymy. Leave "parent taxon" empty.
 <li>"<i>nomen vanum</i>" means that the type material is indeterminate and there is no reasonable chance that further research might help. Leave "parent taxon" empty.
</ul>

<p><b>Spelling</b></p>
There are five possible values related to the spelling of an authority.<br>
<ul>
 <li>"<i>original spelling</i>" means that this was the spelling that the original author used
 <li>"<i>recombined as</i>" means a <u>species</u> is valid but has been moved to another genus. Put the new combination in the parent taxon field.  To create a recombination, add the opinion to the original combination.
 <li>"<i>reassigned as</i>" means a <u>subgenus</u> is valid but has been moved to another genus. Put the new genus in the parent taxon field. Base opinions off the original Genus (Subgenus) name 
For example, Linnaeus called chimps "Homo troglodytes"; the name was recombined by Oken (1816) as "Pan troglodytes," which is still used.
 <li>"<i>corrected as</i>" means that the original spelling was grammatically incorrect and a new spelling has been proposed. To add a correction, add an opinion to the taxon with the <i>original spelling</i>, and type in the name of the corrected spelling in the text field of the "How was it spelled?" section. This new spelling does not have to be already exist in the database.
 <li>"<i>rank changed as</i>" means that the taxon's rank and/or spelling was changed
dd an opinion to the taxon with the original spelling, and place the name of the new spelling and rank "How was it spelled?" section.
It does <i>not</i> matter if the new rank is higher or lower than the old one.
</ul>

<h3>How to handle complicated cases</h3>
</center><p>

<i>Higher taxa:</i>

<ul>
<li><i>All you know about taxon X is what the current paper says.</i> Make one entry for X.
<li><i>Taxon X originally was in some higher taxon G but is now in higher taxon H</i> (<u>classification</u>). Make two entries.
First, fill out a form with X in the taxon name field; G in full in the parent taxon field; and the original authority (the authority who first named X). Second, fill out a form with X, H, and the new authority for the new placement of X.
<li><i>Taxon X has been shuffled among many higher taxa</i> (<u>classification</u>). Fill out multiple forms, with each one giving the higher taxon favored by that authority. Fill out a different form for each paper that renders an opinion, even if lots of authorities said the same thing or if the same authority said the same thing in different papers. <i>You have to do this even if the classification of the taxon has never been debated - in those cases, give the original authority's classification info.</i>
<li><i>Taxon X turns out to be valid and in the correct higher taxon</i> (<u>classification</u>). Fill out multiple forms if you know of multiple opinions, <i>even</i> if the original opinion turns out to be right.
<li><i>Taxon X is a synonym or or otherwise invalid</i> (<u>synonymy/validity</u>). Make sure to fill out one form recording the problem with the name, but also make sure to record the classification that was favored by the original author.
<li><i>Genus G Subgenus (H) was elevated to a genus</i> Fill out a form based off Genus G Subgenus (H), assigning it to a higher taxon in the "How was it classified section".  In the "How was it spelled section" give the spelling as "Genus H" and mark that it was ranked from its original rank of subgenus.
</ul>

<i>Species:</i>

<ul>
<li><i>Species X originally was in genus G but is now in genus H</i> (<u>classification</u>). Add an opinion to the taxon "genus G species X".  Write out "genus H" in the "How was it classified?" section, and Write out "genus H species X" in the "How was it spelled?" section, selecting the "This name is a recombination of 'genus G species X'" from the pulldown in the "How was it spelled?" section. 
<li><i>Species X turns out to be valid and in the correct combination</i> (<u>classification</u>). Write out the same, full genus and species name in the "How was it spelled?" section, the corresponding genus name in the "How was it classified?" section, and select "This name is the original spelling" in the pulldown of the "How was it spelled?" section. <i>Unlike genera and other higher taxa, species only need to be classified if their genus assignment and/or status has been debated.</i>
<li><i>Species X is a synonym or homonym of species Y</i> (<u>synonymy</u>). Select the appropriate status (subjective synonym, objective synonym, homonym) and write out the senior synonym or replacement name X in full (both genus and species) in the parent taxon field. For homonyms, you need to enter TWO opinions: first, the opinion that X is a "homonym of" the other species spelt exactly the same way, and second, the opinion that X has been "replaced by" a new, differently spelt name.
<li><i>Species X is invalid</i> (<u>validity</u>). Select "nomen dubium," "nomen nudum," "nomen oblitum" or "nomen vanum" and leave the senior synonym field <i>blank</i>.
</ul>

<a name="Example"></a>
<h3>How to read a synonymy list</h3>
</center><p>

In a carefully written paper, the systematic paleontology section for each species (and sometimes each genus or even higher taxon) begins with a list of species names found in the earlier literature.
Each row in the list gives the species name that was used, the author and year of the paper where that name was used, and sometimes the page number as well.
Our taxonomic information script generates this kind of a list automatically (you can get it by checking "synonymy" on the taxonomic information page and updating).</p>

<p>Synonymy lists are useful but confusing.
There are two basic conventions for creating them.</p>

<p>First, authors may use a short format that only lists synonyms and alternative combinations in the earlier literature.
This convention is followed by most American authors, and some authors from other continents including Europe.
Each row represents either (a) a naming event (the fact that so-and-so named such-and-such in such-and-such a year), or (b) a recombination.
You can tell a name is a recombination if:</p>

<ul>
<li>The author name is listed in parentheses, as in "(Smith 1900)" - the author's name following an original combination is never in parentheses.
<li>The same species is listed earlier in the synonymy list, but in a different genus.
</ul>

Here's how you handle an American-style list:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first line should show the naming event for the valid species (the one at the top of the list).
Just create an authority record for that name, if none exists yet.
<li>If a line shows a naming event and the name is not the valid species at the top of the list, it's a junior synonym.
Make sure there is an authority record for the synonym, then enter the opinion that the <i>current</i> author thinks it is a synonym.
<li>If a line shows a recombination, either of the valid species or of a synonym, (a) do NOT create an authority record, but (b) do create an opinion that the original combination of that name was recombined by that author in that year.
</ul>

<p>The second format is a long format that is commonly (but not only) used by European authors, and also sometimes by authors from other continents.
It includes not just the synonymy/recombination information listed by the Americans, but also any cases where an earlier author described some material <i>of a totally different, valid species</i> and the present author has reidentified <i>just that material, but not the type</i> as the valid species under consideration.
You can tell right away that you are dealing with a European-style list if you see the letter "v" to the left of some of the names.
This is abbreviated Latin meaning "I saw it" and indicating that this is a list of specimens, not just species.
Another way to tell is when some lines end with <i>partim,</i> meaning that only some of the specimens, and not the type specimens, are being assigned to this species.
So, a <i>partim</i> assignment is never ever a synonymy.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult and dangerous to work with these lists, because you often can't tell if a name is a synonym/recombination or just some reidentified material.
Here are some hints:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the name in the list is followed by <i>partim,</i> ignore it.
<li>If a name is clearly a recombination of the valid species at the top (because the species name is the same but the genus name is different), you need to enter the opinion that that author in the list recombined the name. 
<li>If the name is totally different, check the rest of the text and see if it says specifically that this name is a synonym.
<li>If the author doesn't come out and say the name is a synonym, it still might be.
You can tell if the list includes a name (say, <i>Omomys pucillus</i> Wortman 1904) and elsewhere the paper says that Wortman named <i>Omomys pucillus</i> in that same year.
<li>Maybe you are sure that name X proposed by one author is a synonym, and later you see a recombination of that name in the list by a second author.
Now enter an opinion that the second author recombined the name.
<li>If none of that worked, you don't know what's going on, so give up.
</ul>

<p>Here's an example of an American (= easy) synonymy list with real species names taken from a single make-believe paper ("Smith 2004"), and instructions for entering it.</p>

<center><i>Omomys carteri</i></center>

<table width="100%">
<tr><td align="center">
 <table>
 <tr><td align="left">
   1869 <i>Omomys carteri</i> Leidy<br>
   1872 <i>Palaeacodon vagus</i> Marsh<br>
   1872 <i>Hemiacodon pucillus</i> Marsh<br>
   1872 <i>Hemiacodon nanus</i> Marsh<br>
   1872 <i>Euryacodon lepidus</i> Marsh<br>
   1904 <i>Omomys carteri</i> Wortman<br>
   1904 <i>Omomys pucillus</i> Wortman<br>
   1958 <i>Omomys carteri</i> Gazin<br>
   1976 <i>Omomys carteri</i> Szalay<br>
   1990 <i>Omomys carteri</i> Westgate
</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>What to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Leidy (1869) named <i>carteri.</i>
Create the authority record if it doesn't already exist.
<li>Marsh's <i>vagus, pucillus, nanus,</i> and <i>lepidus</i> are synonyms.
First create authority records for them if needed.
Then enter opinions that the current author (Smith 2004) thinks they are synonyms.
<li>Wortman (1904) also thought that <i>carteri</i> belonged to <i>Omomys</i>.
Enter that opinion.
<li>Wortman (1904) thought that <i>pucillus</i> was valid but recombined it into <i>Omomys</i>.
Enter that opinion too.
<li>The last three authors (Gazin, Szalay, and Westgate) all agreed with Wortman that the original combination of <i>carteri</i> was correct.
Enter an opinion in each case.
</ol>

<p>Note that if this were a European list, we'd only be able to enter the four opinions on <i>carteri</i> saying that it was always placed in its original genus.
However, we might be able to figure out from the text that (say) <i>pucillus</i> is a synonym, allowing us to enter two opinions: the synonymy proposed by Smith (2004), plus the one recombination of <i>pucillus</i> by Wortman.</p>
