<p><b>Specimens measured:</b> This represents how many specimens this record represents. If its 1, this record represents an individual measurement, if its greater than 1, than this record records an average of a set of measurements.</p>
<p><b>Proportion of sample measured:</b> This field is only applicable if specimens measured is greater than 1.</p>
<p><b>Specimen number: </b> </p>
<p><b>Size estimates (mm): </b> If specimens measured is 1, then record the measurements in the value column, else record the average of the set in the value column.  Optionally fill in other data about the set (min,max,etc.).</p>
<p><b>Measurement magnification:</b> This field is only relevant if measurement source is "picture".  In this case, enter the magnification of the picture and the raw, uncalibrated sizes in the value field.  When doing calculations, the calibrated sizes will automatically be calculated and used.</p>
