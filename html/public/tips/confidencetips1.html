<P><B>Summary:</B> Observed stratigraphic ranges almost always underestimate true longevities.  This classic method calculates confidence intervals on the endpoints of local stratigraphic ranges using a Bayesian approach.  This method can also be applied to composite sections; confidence intervals may be placed on times of origin (first occurrence) and extinction (last occurrence) for entire species or lineages.</P>

<B>Summary:</B> The equations for calculating classical confidence intervals on the end points of stratigraphic ranges are based on the restrictive assumption of randomly distributed fossil finds.  This method can be used for calculating confidence intervals on the end-points of stratigraphic ranges with partial relaxation of this assumption: the method will work for any continuous distribution of gap sizes, not just those generated by random processes.  The price paid for the generality of the approach are two-fold: (1) there are uncertainties associated with the sizes of confidence intervals, and (2) for large confidence values (e.g., 95%) a rich fossil record is required to place upper bounds on the corresponding confidence intervals.<p>

<H3>Transposition Test</H3>

<B>Summary:</B> <P> Many confidence interval methods are based on the assumption that there is no significant correlation between gap size and stratigraphic position.  Marshall (1994) suggests using the transposition test (Kreyszig 1979: p. 932) to test for the presence of an increasing or decreasing trend in gap size with stratigraphic position.  The tranposition test is automatically run and outputted for all the above confidence interval methods, regardless of their explicit assumptions.</P>

<P><B>Output:</B> An output of "1" indicates that a significant correlation exists between gap size and stratigraphic position for a given taxon, whereas an output of "0" indicates no sginificant relationship. </P>
