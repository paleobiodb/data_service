			<i>Important: do not assign a value to any fossil that is not a plant. Instead, leave the pulldown blank.</i>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>Unassigned</h3>Plant material that can't be assigned to any of the following categories because no information is given.<p>
				<li><h3>Plant debris</h3>Material that is clearly part of a terrestrial plant but cannot be assigned to any of the following categories because of poor preservation, maceration, etc.<p>
				<li><h3>Marine palynomorph</h3>Reproductive or somatic microfossil of algal, dinoflagellate, or equivalent affinity.<p>
				<li><h3>Microspore</h3>Small haploid spore, roughly < 200 micrometers in equatorial diameter (includes pollen, microspores, and isospores).<p>
				<li><h3>Megaspore</h3>Large haploid spore, roughly > 200 micrometers in equatorial diameter.<p>
				<li><h3>Seed/fruit</h3>Seed plant female reproductive structure (includes ovules and preovules).<p>
				<li><h3>Flower</h3>Angiosperm reproductive axis (includes male, female or bisexual flowers).<p>
				<li><h3>Seed plant reproductive structure.</h3>Compound structure bearing ovules or pollen, including things like cones, scales, etc., but which cannot be placed in &quot;ovules&quot; or &quot;flowers.&quot;<p>
				<li><h3>Non-seed plant reproductive structure</h3> Sporangia or compound structure bearing micro- or megaspores.<p>
				<li><h3>Wood</h3>Fragments of secondary xylem that are not part of a larger morphological structure.<p>
				<li><h3>Axis</h3>Structure clearly forming a trunk, branch, or stem.<p>
				<li><h3>Root</h3>Subterranean axial structure (includes roots and rhizomes). If you are not certain that the structure was subterranean, use &quot;axis.&quot;<p>
				<li><h3>Leaf</h3>Any planar foliar structure regardless of botanical affinity, including petioles.<p>
				<li><h3>Cuticle</h3>Unaltered or altered surficial foliar covering, NOT associated with underlying cells.  If cells are present, use &quot;leaf.&quot;<p>
