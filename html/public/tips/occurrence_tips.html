<h4>Taxon name field</h4>

<p class="medium"><b>General rules</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Enter the full higher taxon, genus, or species name for every taxon tied to the collection, including algae, microfossils, trace fossils, etc.
<li>Always do enter generically indeterminate taxa such as families, orders, and classes.
<li>End the line with <i>indet.</i> if the genus is unknown and <i>sp.</i> or <i>spp.</i> if the genus is known but the species is not known.
<li>Always capitalize genus or higher-order names. Enter "Mytilus alaskensis" or "Theropoda" and not "mytilus alaskensis," "Mytilus Alaskensis," "MYTILUS ALASKENSIS," "theropoda," or "THEROPODA."
<li>Enter subgenus names in parentheses, as in <i>Equus (Equus) caballus</i>.
<li>Never abbreviate the genus or subgenus name.
<li>Never capitalize the species name.
<li>Use <i>spp.</i> for multiple unnamed species in the same genus.
<li>Put subspecies or variety names in the comments field.
<li>Put author names like Linnaeus 1758 in the comments field.
</ul>

<p class="medium"><b>Qualifiers</b></p>

<ul>

<li>
<p class="medium">The following modifiers of genus and species names may be used. See definitions below.</p>

<blockquote>aff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cf.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ex gr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sensu lato&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n. gen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n. subgen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n. sp.</blockquote>

<li>
<p class="medium">You may use exactly one modifier each for the genus, subgenus, and species names, so if there is more than one, pick the most important.</p>

<li>
<p class="medium">Modifiers normally come before the names they modify. Examples:</p>

<blockquote>
n. gen. Equus n. sp. caballus<br>
aff. Equus ? caballus<br>
sensu lato Equus sp.<br>
cf. Equidae indet.
</blockquote>

<li>
<p class="medium">The following exceptions are allowed:</p>

<blockquote>
Equus caballus n. gen. n. sp.<br>
Equus caballus n. sp.<br>
Equus n. sp.<br>
Equus caballus sensu lato
</blockquote>

<li>
<p class="medium">Quotes also are modifiers, but go where you would expect them to:</p>

<blockquote>
"Equus" sp.
</blockquote>

<li>
<p class="medium">
Only enter <i>n. sp.</i> if the type specimen comes from this particular collection (not just any collection mentioned in the same paper).
</p>

<li>
<p class="medium">
Do not enter <i>n. gen.</i> if a species is new but it is <i>not</i> the type species of the genus.
</p>

<li>
<p class="medium">
If an identification says "Xus cf. X. yus," ignore the "X." part. Repeating an abbreviation for the genus name is grammatically correct but totally uninformative.
</p>

</ul>

<p class="medium"><b>Informal names</b></p>

<ul>

<li>
<p class="medium">
Names that are not properly formed according to Linnean rules may still be entered. Put them in &lt; &gt; symbols like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
&lt;Stromatolite&gt; indet.<br>
Equus &lt;sp. A&gt;
</blockquote>

<li>
<p class="medium">
You can enter multiple unnamed but lettered or numbered species like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
Equus &lt;sp. A&gt;<br>
Equus &lt;sp. 9&gt;<br>
Equus &lt;form B&gt;
</blockquote>

<li>
<p class="medium">
Avoid entering informal English names for higher taxa. Translate names like "horse," "bryozoan," "coral," "crinoid," "shark," and "fish" into Linnean names like Equidae indet., Bryozoa indet., Anthozoa indet., Crinoidea indet., Chondrichthyes indet., and Actinopterygii indet.
</p>

<li>
<p class="medium">
Whenever possible, enter the Linnean name of the higher taxon and make the species name informal, not the other way around.
For example, if the author listed "new bryozoan A," enter:
</p>

<blockquote>
Bryozoa &lt;new A&gt;
</blockquote>

<li>
<p class="medium">
Morphotype codes such as "WA56" should be entered along with higher taxon names in a similar way:
</p>

<blockquote>
Betulaceae &lt;WA56&gt;
</blockquote>

</ul>

<p class="medium"><b>Qualifiers defined</b></p>

<ul>
<li><i>aff.</i> = has affinity with (related to but not the same as)
<li><i>cf.</i> = compare with (similar to but not definitely the same as)
<li><i>ex gr.</i> = of the group including (similar to "aff.")
<li><i>sensu lato</i> = broadly defined, e.g., because the genus or species is non-monophyletic, rests on a poor type, or is being used as a form taxon
<li><i>?</i> = questionably identified as (similar to "cf.")
<li><i>" "</i> = broadly defined (similar to sensu lato)
<li><i>n. gen.</i> = new genus
<li><i>n. subgen.</i> = new subgenus
<li><i>n. sp.</i> = new species
</ul>


<p class="medium"><b>Rare qualifiers</b></p>

The following rare terms correspond to ours as follows (if there is no equivalent, make a note in the comments field):
<ul>
<li><i>f.</i> = nothing (used below species level)
<li><i>gen. nov.</i> = n. gen.
<li><i>gr.</i> = ex gr.
<li><i>n. g.</i> = n. gen.
<li><i>nov. gen.</i> = n. gen.
<li><i>nov. sp.</i> = n. sp.
<li><i>sensu stricto</i> = nothing (implicit for most IDs)
<li><i>s. l.</i> = sensu lato
<li><i>sp. inc.</i> = nothing (put sp. in species name field)
<li><i>sp. ind.</i> = nothing (put sp. in species name field)
<li><i>sp. nov.</i> = n. sp.
<li><i>s. s.</i> = nothing (= sensu stricto)
<li><i>ssp.</i> = nothing (= subspecies)
<li><i>subsp.</i> = nothing (= subspecies)
<li><i>var.</i> = nothing (used below species level)
</ul>

<h4>Other fields</h4>

<a name="Abundance"></a>

<p>
<b>Abundance</b><br>
Optional, so the occurrence still will "count" even if you leave this field blank. Integers and real numbers are both okay.
</p>

<p>
It is very important only to enter abundance data when they are ecologically meaningful. Do not enter counts if:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The paper is about the taxonomy of one species, counts are only given for it, and others are present.
<li>Counts are only given for one group (say, echinoderms), and most species belong to other groups (say, brachiopods or molluscs).
<li>Counts are given for most groups, but only the group of interest is identified at least to the genus level, and the others are listed by family, order, or other higher taxon even though they probably could have been identified more precisely.
<li>Counts are given for some or even many species, but not for the common ones.
<li>Specimens are listed in a systematic paleontology section, but it's possible that most specimens of the common species were not collected and described.
<li>One or more species have very large counts because fragments (e.g., crinoid stem ossicles, sponge spicules) were counted, but counts of other species are of real individuals (e.g., mollusc shells). In these cases, you can still enter the counts of individuals.
<li>The data are for bulk samples, but counts also include individuals of species found elsewhere on the outcrop.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Abundance unit</b><br>
Required if you have entered an abundance value. For count data, select <i>individuals</i> for mostly or entirely complete shells or skeletons, or for MNI counts given by the authors; <i>elements</i> for counts of small, non-unique parts like spicules, ossicles, and scales; and <i>fragments</i> for small pieces that are not whole parts.
If you can't tell the difference, select <i>specimens</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Reference</b><br>
Enter the ID number of the relevant reference if the occurrence is not documented in the same reference as the collection.
For example, if the main collection reference is about crinoids and a second reference adds some identifications of brachiopods, write in the Paleobiology Database ID number of the brachiopod reference whenever you enter an identification from that paper.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comments</b><br>
If it was hard to decide whether and how to enter the occurrence, explain what you did.
If you have modified the identification that originally appeared in the main reference, make sure to add a comment indicating what you have done and describing the original identification.
You also may record details like specimen numbers and body parts in this field.
</p>

<p>
<b>Classification</b><br>
After you submit the occurrences, you will see a taxonomic list that includes the appropriate higher order names (class, order, and family).
If a name is not classified or the higher order names are wrong, take the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the "Add/edit taxonomic name" function to add the name to master list of names (= the "authorities" table).
<li>Use the "Add/edit taxonomic opinion" function to record the next higher taxon it belongs to (e.g., for a genus, record the family, subfamily, or tribe).
</ul>

<p>
If the name is classified incorrectly, the version we have actually may be a different thing. For example, perhaps your taxon is a plant and we only have a record for an animal name that is spelt the same way. If so, then create a new authority record, create an opinion record, and use the "Reclassify occurrences" tool to reassign your occurrence to the correct higher taxon.
</ul>
