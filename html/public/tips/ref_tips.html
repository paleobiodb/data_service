<H3>Searching for references</H3>

<b><A NAME="ReferenceSearch"></A>Data contributor</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> field. If your name is not on the list, chose the name of the person you are working with.<p>

<b>First author's last name</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> field. It and the next field are needed to perform a search of the database's existing list of references.<p>

<b>Publication year</b><br>
This is an optional field, but it can be helpful if you want to avoid getting back too many matches to your search.<p>

<hr>
<a name="refentry"></a>
<H3>Entering and editing references</H3>

<b><A NAME="ReferenceData"></A>"Choose one" list of references</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> choice. WARNING: if you find a match, it is possible that someone else already has entered the collection.<p>

<b>First author's initials</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> field, except when entering institutions or anonymous authors.  Do not spell out the author's full name. Do put a period after each initial, and a space between each pair of initials. One, two, or three initials are OK.<p>

<b>First author's last name</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> field.  The value anon. or anonymous can be used for unknown author(s).  Hyphenated names are OK, as are spaces separating parts of multi-word names like "van Rijn."<p>

<b>Second author's initials</b><br>
Not required for single-author papers. Third, fourth, etc. authors are not listed here, but in the comment field below.<p>

<b>Second author's last name</b><br>
Not required.<p>

<b>Initials and names of additional authors</b><br>
List the the third, fourth, fifth, etc. authors in order, initials first. Comma separators are optional. The word "and" before the last author is optional and not recommended.<p>

<b>Publication year</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> field. Use the actual date of publication, if available, not the nominal year of publication for the volume.<p>

<b>Publication type</b><br>
Choose the closest possible value. "unpublished" includes field notes, manuscripts, undergraduate theses, etc.; "guidebook" includes individual articles in guidebooks.<p>

<b>Title</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> field. Type in the entire title and do not use abbreviations. Use of colons and semi-colons is OK.
If the title is not in English, enter the original title first, and then enter an English-language translation in brackets. Example:<p>

<blockquote>&Eacute;tude sur les rostroconches du Danien sup&eacuterieur de Topeka [A study of the upper Danian rostroconchs of Topeka]</blockquote>

For a thesis, enter only the name of the institution (e.g., "University of Saskatchewan").<p>

<b>Full name of serial</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> field.
If you are citing a book, enter the full name here, following this style:<br>
<i>B. Dobbs and B. Young, eds., Drab Gray Fossils From Lithuania. Hokum Press, Lagos, Nigera.</i><br>
If you are citing a book chapter, enter the same information but start the entry with <i>in</i> (as in <i>"in B. Dobbs and B. Young, eds., ...").</i><p>

<b>Volume</b><br>
Required only for serials, not for books.<p>

<b>Number</b><br>
Optional.<p>

<b>First page</b><br>
This is a <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">required</FONT> field. Do NOT add a hyphen after the page number; this will be done automatically by the data entry processing program.
If you are citing an entire book, put "1" here and the total number of pages in the last page field.
If the pages are numbered with combinations of numbers and letters (e.g., "A-32") put everything in an do not strip out the letters.<p>

<b>Last page</b><br>
Required only if the paper actually is longer than one page (many abstracts have only one page).<p>
