<center><h2>Data entry tutorial</h2></center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The Paleobiology Database has many data tables and many scripts used to enter and edit data in the tables.
In this tutorial you will step through the procedure for entering data into each major table, stopping short right before submitting.

<h3>Public pages</h3>

The first step is to check some of the public web pages that explain the Database.

<ol>
<li>Go to <u>paleodb.org</u>.
<li>Hit <u>public area</u>.
<li>Hit <u>Frequently asked questions</u> and read the entire page.
Pay careful attention to the sections "What is the database structure?"; "How is the Database organized?"; "Who can join..."; "How can I form a research group..."; and "Who has access..."
<li>Hit <u>Home</u> in the blue navigation bar.
<li>Hit <u>General data entry tip sheet</u> and read the entire page. Pay very close attention to the "General comments."
<li>Hit <u>Home</u> and successively read the three other tip sheets.
</ol>

<h3>Logging in</h3>

To do any data entry, you must log in to the "Contributors' area," which is password-protected and closed to the public.
<ol>
<li>Starting on the public web site, hit <u>Contributors' area</u> on the navigation bar.
<li>Select the "Authorizer" and "Enterer" names. The authorizer is typically the Ph.D. who is supervising a data entry project; the enterer could be the same as the authorizer, but more often is a student or postdoc working with the authorizer.
<li>Enter the "Password" of the authorizer and hit <u>Login to system</u>.
<li>If you enter the wrong password or select the wrong authorizer name, you will be bounced right back to the public home page. Hit <u>Contributors' area</u> to go back to the login page.
<li>You should now be on the data entry "Main menu," a.k.a. <u>Paleobiology Database functions</u>.
If you ever need to get back to this page from anywhere in the contributors' area, hit <u>Main menu</u> in the navigation bar.
</ol>

<h3>References</h3>

Every major table in the Database is tied back to the references table, which tracks publications yielding assorted data.
We record references only if they include some enterable data, and we avoid references (such as review articles) that repeat information from earlier publications.
Reference records have a straightforward structure, with author names, publication years, article and journal titles, etc.

<ol>
<li>From the main menu, hit <u>Add a new reference</u> under "Reference functions."
<li>You don't want to enter a duplicate reference, so you must search our data to see if the ref is already there before you continue.
Try a very simple search just using the author's last name.
<li>If there are matches, you will get a list.
If none of the refs are the same as yours, hit <u>Add reference</u>.
<li>If you got no matches, or if you hit the <u>Add reference</u> button, you will get a data entry form.
Fill out every field you can.
Don't worry about the project codes if you don't know what they are; if you can, use the "serial's name" pulldown to avoid filling out the "full name" field.
<li>In a real session you would be ready for submission.
Instead, hit <u>Main menu</u>.
</ol>

<h3>Collections</h3>

We separate information about fossil collections into two tables that have different data entry forms.
For the collections table there is a lengthy form that records all the contextual information: geography, stratigraphy, lithology, taphonomy, collection methods, etc.
Each collection is supposed to represent the most geographically and stratigraphically restricted unit you can identify, and ultimately would correspond to the fossils collection from one bed in one spot by one worker in one field season.

<ol>
<li>From the main menu, hit <u>Add a new collection</u> under "Collection functions."
<li>You must have a "current reference" to enter any data.
The Database gives you a chance to select one whenever you start the data entry process.
Because this is just a demonstration, you should pick any arbitrary ref; if you were really entering data, you would have to be careful to get the right one. 
So, fill in the "Author's last name" with something common like Johnson and hit <u>Search</u>.
<li>Click on the radio button next to one of the references and hit <u>Select reference</u>.
<li>You don't want to enter a duplicate collection, so you must search to see if similar collections have been entered.
Try a very broad but meaningful search of the collections table.
Examples: fill in one short word from the "Collection name" only; fill in "County" only; fill in one word from the "Formation" name only.
Do NOT search by "Authorizer" or "Enterer."
<li>You should get back a list of similar collections.
Make sure none of them are the same as the one you are trying to create.
It helps to click on the collection names, look at the full records on the resulting pages, and then hit the back button to get back to the list.
<li>If you did not find any matching collections, or if you hit <u>Add a new collection</u>, you will get a data entry form.
Fill out every field you can following the instructions on the <a href="javascript: tipsPopup('/public/tips/tips.html')">general data entry tip sheet</a>.
<li>Once you're done, don't hit <u>Enter new collection</u>; instead, hit <u>Main menu</u>.
</ol>

<h3>Occurrences</h3>

The "occurrences" comprise the taxonomic list for a collection, plus abundance data, comments, etc.
You can't create occurrences unless you have (or someone has) already created the corresponding collection.
You may add new occurrences to an existing list entered by someone else under a different authorizer's name.

<ol>
<li>From the main menu, hit <u>Add/edit occurrences for a collection</u> under "Taxonomy and occurrence functions."
<li>If you don't have a current reference or want to change it, do a search.
Otherwise hit <u>Use current reference</u>.
<li>To see the occurrences, you need to find the collection they belong do.
Enter some broad and meaningful search terms and hit <u>Search collections</u>.
<li>The search should return a list of collections.
Click the highlighted collection number to the left of the collection that you want.
<li>You can now modify old occurrences and/or create new ones by typing in names below the old records.
Note that the genus/higher taxon and species/sp./indet. fields are required.
If your authorizer doesn't own the old records, they won't be writeable.
<li>Once you're done, don't hit <u>Save changes</u>; instead, hit <u>Main menu</u>.
</ol>

<h3>Reidentifications</h3>

If a newer paper says that the identification in an older taxonomic list is wrong, you need to record the new ID or "reidentification."
Note that we do not encourage simply changing the occurrence itself; instead, we want to know what name originally was used (the occurrence) and what name now should be used (the reidentification).

<ol>
<li>From the main menu, hit <u>Reidentify occurrences</u> under "Taxonomy and occurrence functions."
<li>If you don't have a current reference or want to change it, do a search.
Otherwise hit <u>Use current reference</u>.
<li>You now have a collection search form that can be used in two ways.
First, you might want all occurrences in one collection.
Most of the fields can be used for this kind of a search.
Hit <u>Search collections</u> when you have entered the right search terms for that collection.
<li>As with the occurrence search, you will be given a list of collections.
Click the highlighted number of the collection you want.
<li>Second, you might want multiple occurrences of the same taxon, not necessarily from just one collection.
Fill out the field for taxonomic names and no other fields, and then hit <u>Search collections</u>.
<li>Either way, at this point you should have a list of occurrences with original identifications printed at top and lines with input fields for reidentifications.
Fill out only the reidentifications you need to, ignoring the others.
If the first page doesn't have the occurrences you need to correct, hit the <u>View next 10 occurrences</u> link to navigate forwards.
<li>Once you're done, don't hit <u>Save reidentifications</u>; instead, hit <u>Main menu</u>.
</ol>

<h3>Taxonomic data</h3>

We have two tables that handle all the basic information of alpha taxonomy.
Who named what when (e.g., Linnaeus named Homo in 1758) is recorded in our authorities table.
The status of a name - either how it should be classified, what it should be synonymized, or why it's flat-out useless - is recorded in our opinions table.
We have one medium-length form that feeds into both tables.

<ol>
<li>From the main menu, hit <u>Add taxonomic information</u> under "Taxonomy and occurrence functions."
<li>If you don't have a current reference or want to change it, do a search.
Otherwise hit <u>Use current reference</u>.
<li>You now have a simple form that asks you to find a taxon by entering its exact name.
This crucial step is needed to make sure that a "new" taxonomic name has not already been entered into the system; or, if you are editing an existing name, to make sure you find it.
So, be very careful to enter the name fully and correctly.
<li>If there are one or more existing names spelt like yours, you will be given a list ending with a choice to "create a <b>new</b> taxon."
If you are revising an existing name, choose it based on its author and/or the higher-order taxon that includes it.
Otherwise, just select the last radio button.
<li>One way or another, at this stage you will be presented with a taxonomic data entry form.
It includes a part for authority information and a part for opinion data.
Carefully consult the <a href="javascript: tipsPopup('/public/tips/taxonomy_tips.html')">taxonomy data entry tip sheet</a> before you fill in any of the fields.
<li>Once you're done, don't hit <u></u>; instead, hit <u>Main menu</u>.
</ol>

<h3>Images</h3>

The Database can store image files such as JPG, GIF, or PNG.
However, the images have to be tied to taxonomic names stored in the authorities table (see above).

<ol>
<li>From the main menu, hit <u>Add an image</u> under "Taxonomy and occurrence functions."
<li>Unlike the other functions, this one doesn't require you to choose a reference.
However, it's crucial that you associate the picture with a valid taxon name.
Enter the full, correctly spelt name of the species or higher taxon that appears in the picture.
If you get a "Not found" error, hit the <u>provide the taxonomic information</u> link and folow the usual "Add taxonomic data" procedure (see above) to enter the name and authority of the taxon in the picture.
<li>You will be presented with a form whose main purpose is to ask for the name of an image file on your computer, then allow you to browse through your directory hierarchy so you can upload it.
You can view any of the images you upload by going through the <u>Search for a taxon</u> link on the <u>Main menu</u>.
The caption is optional but will appear below the images.
Note that you can only upload one image at a time; if you have multiple images of the same species, start the procedure over again for each one.
<li>Once you're done, don't hit <u>Enter new collection</u>; instead, hit <u>Main menu</u>.
</ol>
