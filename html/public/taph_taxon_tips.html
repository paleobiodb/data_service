Authors: Behrensmeyer, Gastaldo, Kidwell, Kosnik, Kowalewski, Rogers, Plotnick</i><p>

* Note: Asterisked fields apply in particular to a project to assess taphonomic durability through the Phanerozoic for Bivalves, Gastropods, and Brachiopods but may be used for other taxonomic groups where appropriate.<p>

<B>Skeletal composition 1 and 2.</B><br>  These values refer to the ORIGINAL composition of the skeleton, not the preserved composition. For the latter, see &quot;Replacement Minerals&quot; on the Main Collections Form. The first entry should be the dominant composition, the second is reserved for secondary components, e.g., sponges that have siliceous and CaCO<SUB>3</SUB> skeletal elements. Quotes indicate a value that should be used only if a more specific value cannot be determined<B>.  &quot;</B>Entirely soft-tissued&quot; refers to organisms such as jellyfish and flatworms. Non skeletonized refers to all organisms without biomineralized skeletal elements (e.g. plants)

<ul>
<li>aragonite
<li>"calcite"
<li>high Mg calcite
<li>low Mg calcite
<li>hydroxyapatite  
<li>calcified cartilage  
<li>silica
<li>celestine (SrSO4)
<li>agglutinated
<li>non-skeletonized
<li>chitin
<li>lignin
<li>"sclero-protein"  (includes keratin)

<li>cutan/cutin
<li>non-skeletonized
</ul>

<B>Adult size with units</B><br>
Provide size information using the millimeter categories (&quot;value&quot; pull-down menu) listed below for linear, areal, or volumetric estimates (selected under &quot;units&quot; pull-down menu). For example, for volume, an organism that is .03 mm on a side would be in the smallest category and a whale 30 m x 5m x 5m would be in the &gt;10^8 to &lt; 10^9 category.  Applies to measures of whole body size, e.g., maximum axial length or other maximum dimension, maximum area of plan view projection, volume calculated as length x width x height.

<ul>
<li>&lt;0.0001
<li>&gt;0.0001 to 0.001
<li>&gt;0.001 to 0.01
<li>&gt;0.01 to 0.1
<li>&gt;0.1 to &lt; 1.0
<li>&gt;1.0 to &lt; 10
<li>&gt;10 to &lt; 100
<li>&gt;100 to &lt; 1000
<li>&gt;1000 to &lt; 10^4
<li>&gt;10^4 to &lt; 10^5
<li>&gt;10^5 to &lt; 10^6
<li>&gt;10^6 to &lt; 10^7
<li>&gt;10^7 to &lt; 10^8
<li>&gt;10^8 to &lt; 10^9
<li>&gt;10^9 to &lt; 10^10
<li>&gt;10^10 to &lt; 10^11
<li>&gt;10^11 or more
</ul>

<B>Units for body size
</B><br>
Be sure to select the appropriate unit for the estimate made above.
<ul>
<li>length (mm)
<li>area (mm2)
<li>volume (mm3)
</ul>

<b>*Relative thickness</B><br>
Thick versus intermediate versus thin.  Refer to visual images to judge this character.  Thick shells have a high ratio of overall (average) thickness relative to body size, thin shells have a low ratio of thickness relative to body size.<p>

<B>*Internal skeletal architecture</B><br>
This only applies to original architecture of biomineralized tissues. We regard brachiopod shells with punctae as porous.  Bivalve and gastropod shells generally have compact skeletal tissue (watch for exceptions such as pycnodont oysters that display porous shell structure).

<ul>
<li>Porous: Conspicuous voids within the skeletal tissues.
<li>Compact or Dense: Few or no voids within the skeletal tissues.
</ul>

<B>*3-D Form</B><br>
Overall shape of the organism or taphonomically relevant major part.  For bivalves, consider the shape of single valves, for brachiopods, use shape of both valves together.  This is justified on the basis of which components of the organisms are typically subjected to the majority of taphonomic processes.  (Note that the following terms were formulated for use in Project 1 of the Taphonomy Working Group and may not be readily applicable to organisms other than bivalves, gastropods, and brachiopods.)

<ul>
<li>Sheet: sheet-like, one dimension very short relative to the other two, e.g., <I>Pinna</I>, <I>Pecten</I>, strophomenid brachiopods (<I>Schizophoria</I>), Lingula.
<li>Blade: flat and elongate, one dimension significantly longer than the others, e.g., razor clam (<I>Ensis, Siliqua</I>)
<li>Inflated blade: elongate, curved valves, as in mussels
<li>Inflated sheet: flattened, hemispherical shells as in <I>Cerastoderma</I>.
<li>Roller-shaped: cylinder, e.g., high-spired gastropods such as <I>Turritella.
</I><br>Spherical: all 3 axes similar in length, e.g., <I>Natica</I> (moon snail), <I>Terebratula</I>.
</ul>

<B>*Skeletal reinforcement</B><br>
This is meant to apply to features of shell surfaces but could also pertain to leaves, scutes, carapaces.  If shell is smooth and lacks skeletal reinforcements, check this box &quot;smooth&quot; and ignore pull-down menus for skeletal reinforcement features. Options for each pull-down menu are major, minor, absent.  Major features are comparable to or greater than the thickness of the shell and should cover a notable portion of the shell surface. Minor features are less than the shell thickness and cover small areas of the shell surface. (Note that the following terms were formulated for use in Project 1 of the Taphonomy Working Group and may not be readily applicable to organisms other than bivalves, gastropods, and brachiopods.)

<ul>
<li>Smooth: even surface (except for growth banding), lacking ribs, spines and folds...
<li>Ribs: repeated, parallel, linear, raised structures on shell surfaces.
<li>Spines (or spine bases): pointed, typically elongate appendages on shell surfaces.
<li>Folds: plications, undulations or other folds in shell surface as in <I>Spirifer</I>, involves whole shell; thickness remains consistent across folds.
</ul>

<B>Adult polymorphism/dimorphism</B><br>
Applies to distinctive dimorphs or polymorphs that reflect sexual dimorphism or other morphological variation in adults due to possible causes such as population density, temperature, nutrient supply, and other external environmental factors.  This does not relate to normal phenotypic variation in a population.<p>

<B>Ontogeny</B><br>
The different ways that organisms can grow into adults.  Accretion applies to body types that grow incrementally, as in bivalves and solitary corals. Both molting and addition of parts applies to arthropods.  Plants grow both by accretion and by addition of parts. Modification of parts and accretion applies to vertebrates.  Includes astogeny of colonial organisms, and for these check &quot;addition of parts&quot; in addition to any other appropriate boxes.<p>

<ul>
<li>accretion
<li>molting
<li>addition of parts
<li>modification of parts
<li>replacement of parts
</ul>

<B>Social Grouping</B><br>
Designates the dominant type of social organization among individuals in a population. Colonial organisms are physically attached to each other in a structural framework, e.g., bryozoans, corals. Social insects and oyster banks should be classified as gregarious rather than colonial.

<ul>
<li>colonial
<li>gregarious
<li>solitary
</ul>

<B>Clonal</B><br>
Enter yes if individuals can develop from pre-existing individuals without sexual reproduction.  All prokaryotes, some aphids, some beetles, and some plants are clonal; some corals and bryozoans can produce clones.<p>

<B>General Environment</B><br>
Characterizes the overall life habitat of adult individuals of the taxon.

<ul>
<li>hypersaline
<li>marine
<li>brackish
<li>freshwater
<li>terrestrial
</ul>

<B>Locomotion</B><br>
Characterizes the dominant locomotory capabilities of adults. Stationary refers to fixed in place without capability of changing location (relation to substrate), e.g., vascular plants, corals, bryozoa, barnacles, oysters.  Facultatively mobile organisms can change location but do so infrequently, e.g., crinoids, some infaunal bivalves. Floating organisms and epibionts on living mobile organisms are passively mobile. Organisms that move habitually, of their own volition, are actively mobile.

<ul>
<li>stationary
<li>facultatively mobile
<li>passively mobile
<li>actively mobile
</ul>

<B>Attached?</B><br>
Is the adult organism attached to a substrate?<p>

<B>Epibiont?</B><br>
Is the organism an epibiont?  Any organism that is attached to another organism during part of its life cycle is an epibiont.<p>
