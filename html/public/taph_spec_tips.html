Taphonomy Tip Sheet - SPECIMEN DATA Form

INTRINSIC VARIABLES

Body size with units
Provide size information using the millimeter categories ("value" pull-down menu) listed below for linear, areal, or volumetric estimates (selected under "units" pull-down menu). For example, for volume, a specimen that is .03 mm on a side would be in the smallest category and a whole whale 30 m x 5m x 5m would be in the >10^8 to < 10^9 category.  Applies to measures of whole body size, e.g., maximum axial length or other maximum dimension, maximum area of plan view projection, volume calculated as length x width x height.

<0.0001
>0.0001 to 0.001
>0.001 to 0.01
>0.01 to 0.1
>0.1 to < 1.0
>1.0 to < 10
>10 to < 100
>100 to < 1000
>1000 to < 10^4
>10^4 to < 10^5
>10^5 to < 10^6
>10^6 to < 10^7
>10^7 to < 10^8
>10^8 to < 10^9
>10^9 to < 10^10
>10^10 to < 10^11
>10^11 or more

TAPHONOMIC VARIABLES

Modes of preservation
These boxes record the kind of fossil that is present (body, cast, etc.). Check as many of them as apply to the specimen. Check boxes only if you have unambiguous information. Impressions, casts, and molds are fossils with none of the original biomineralized or organic tissue preserved. These three categories are differentiated from each other as follows: "impression" may be a 2D fossil (e.g., leaf impression),  "cast" means a 3D fossil that is a positive image of the original,  "mold" means a 3D fossil that is a negative image of the original.

body
cast
mold
impression
adpression/compression
trace
soft parts
recrystallized
permineralized
charcoalification
coalified

Overall preservational quality
excellent
good
medium
poor

Original biominerals or organics preserved  
These values refer to the ORIGINAL composition of the skeleton, not the preserved composition. For the latter, see "Replacement Minerals" below.  If type of organic compound is unknown, mark carbon.

aragonite
"calcite"
high Mg calcite
low Mg calcite
hydroxyapatite  
calcified cartilage  
silica
celestine (SrSO4)
agglutinated
chitin
lignin
"sclero-protein"  (includes keratin)
carbon
sporopolenin

Replacement/Permineralization minerals
These values refer to the secondary or tertiary minerals that have replaced the original biomineralized or organic tissues of the organism.  These include void-filling minerals in the case of permineralization.

Calcite
Dolomite
Silica
Pyrite
Hematite
Limonite
Phosphate
Carbon

Bioerosion
A qualitative assessment of the degree to which individual elements in the assemblage were bored, excavated, dissolved, etc. by other organisms.
yes
no

Encrustation
A qualitative assessment of the degree to which individual elements in the assemblage have been overgrown by one or more organisms.

yes
no

Dissolution traces
Check box if there is evidence of chemical or biochemical dissolution

Feeding/predation traces
Check all of the following that apply to specimens within the collection based either on original reference or other unambiguous source.  If more than one characteristic applies, score in both pull-down menus.

drill holes - singular perforations that can be attributed to predatory/parasitic activity 
repair scars - breakage, fracture, or other sublethal damage to an organism that shows evidence of healing
fractures - breakage sustained by an organism that shows no evidence of healing
punctures - irregular perforations or indentations that can be attributed to predatory/parasitic activity
tooth marks - punctures or grooves that can be attributed to processing by dental apparatus (shearing plates, teeth, etc.)
gastric dissolution - pitting and etching that can be attributed to acid dissolution within a gut 
margin feeding - evidence of biting, chewing, or removal of tissues along the margin of a leaf or pinnule (photosynthetic unit)
mining - evidence of subcutaneous ingestion of tissues within a photosynthetic unit

Fragmentation
A qualitative assessment of the degree to which individual elements in the assemblage are broken.
complete
broken

Abrasion
unabraded
light abrasion
heavy abrasion

Original pigmentation
yes
no

Disarticulation
These fields are intended to characterize the specimen in a qualitative sense.  Each of the three categories should be completed with none, some, many, or all as applicable.

articulated  
disarticulated but associated
disassociated  

Distortion
yes
no
