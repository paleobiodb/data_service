<b>Modes of preservation</b><br>
These boxes record the kind(s) of fossil(s) that are present (body, cast, etc.) and the mineral composition of the fossils. Check as many of them as apply to any of the fossils in the collection. Check boxes only if you have unambiguous information; just because you suspect that the fossils are actual body fossils and not molds or casts doesn't mean you should check a box. Impressions, casts, and molds are fossils with none of the original biomineralized or organic tissue preserved. These three categories are differentiated from each other as follows: "impression" may be a 2D fossil (e.g., leaf impression),  "cast" means a 3D fossil that is a positive image of the original,  "mold" means a 3D fossil that is a negative image of the original.

<ul>
<li>body
<li>cast
<li>mold
<li>impression
<li>adpression/compression
<li>trace
<li>soft parts
<li>recrystallized
<li>permineralized
<li>charcoalification
<li>coalified
</ul>

<b>Original biominerals or organics preserved</b><br>
These values refer to the ORIGINAL composition of the skeleton, not the preserved composition. For the latter, see "Replacement Minerals" below.  If type of organic compound is unknown, mark carbon.

<ul>
<li>aragonite
<li>"calcite"
<li>high Mg calcite
<li>low Mg calcite
<li>hydroxyapatite  
<li>calcified cartilage  
<li>silica
<li>celestine (SrSO4)
<li>agglutinated
<li>chitin
<li>lignin
<li>"sclero-protein"  (includes keratin)
<li>carbon
<li>sporopolenin
</ul>

<b>Replacement/permineralization minerals</b><br>
These values refer to the secondary or tertiary minerals that have replaced the original biomineralized or organic tissues of the organism.  These include void-filling minerals in the case of permineralization.

<ul>
<li>calcite
<li>dolomite
<li>silica
<li>pyrite
<li>hematite
<li>limonite
<li>phosphate
<li>carbon
</ul>

<b>Special modes of occurrence</b><br>
<ul>
<li>amber - includes true amber, copal, and dammar
<li>concretion - Mazon creek nodules are one end member, but mineral encrustations should be considered as incipient concretion formation
<li>coprolite - fossil feces, includes cololite (intestinal cast)
<li>midden - accumulation of fecal matter or other remains concentrated by an organism's behavior
</ul>

<b>Spatial orientation</b><br>
This field applies to the dominant orientation of the organisms in the assemblage.
<ul>
<li>life position - most individuals are positioned as they were when living (e.g., obrution deposit)
<li>random - no preferential orientation can be distinguished
<li>preferred - some directionality in alignment or organization of elements in the assemblage.
</ul>

<b>Preservation of anatomical detail</b><br>
This represents the most common type of preservation in the assemblage as indicated in the publication (text and/or plates) or as identified from the collection under consideration.
<ul>
<li>excellent - delicate and fine-scale features are obvious (e.g., feathers, cellular detail, spines,  thin-delicate projections, original color pattern, soft tissues) on complete specimens.
<li>good - hard part morphology readily visible and unaltered, may be  partly fragmented
<li>medium - overall morphology preserved but delicate features are degraded if known in the taxon; assignment to family level or below is still possible.
<li>poor - highly degraded or fragmented, few if any diagnostic characteristics are present
<li>variable - this term is restricted to circumstances where disparate preservational styles occur in the same collection/assemblage
</ul>

<b>Age spectra</b><br>
<ul>
<li>adults only
<li>juveniles only
<li>both
</ul>
 
<b>Fragmentation</b><br>
A qualitative assessment of the degree to which individual elements in the assemblage are broken.
<ul>
<li>none 
<li>occasional
<li>frequent
<li>extreme
</ul>

<b>Abrasion</b><br>

<ul>
<li>unabraded
<li>light abrasion
<li>heavy abrasion
</ul>

<b>Bioerosion</b><br>
A qualitative assessment of the degree to which individual elements in the assemblage were bored, excavated, dissolved, etc. by other organisms.
<ul>
<li>yes
<li>no
<li>%
</ul>

<b>Encrustation</b><br>
A qualitative assessment of the degree to which individual elements in the assemblage have been overgrown by one or more organisms.
<ul>
<li>yes
<li>no
<li>%
</ul>

<b>Dissolution</b><br>
Check box if there is evidence of chemical or biochemical dissolution.<p>

<b>Feeding/predation traces</b><br>
Check all of the following that apply to specimens within the collection based either on original reference or other unambiguous source.  If more than one characteristic applies, score in both pull-down menus.

<ul>
<li>drill holes - singular perforations that can be attributed to predatory/parasitic activity 
<li>repair scars - breakage, fracture, or other sublethal damage to an organism that shows evidence of healing
<li>fractures - breakage sustained by an organism that shows no evidence of healing
<li>punctures - irregular perforations or indentations that can be attributed to predatory/parasitic activity
<li>tooth marks - punctures or grooves that can be attributed to processing by dental apparatus (shearing plates, teeth, etc.)
<li>gastric dissolution - pitting and etching that can be attributed to acid dissolution within a gut 
<li>margin feeding - evidence of biting, chewing, or removal of tissues along the margin of a leaf or pinnule (photosynthetic unit)
<li>mining - evidence of subcutaneous ingestion of tissues within a photosynthetic unit
</ul>

<b>Articulation/element representation</b><br>
These fields are intended to characterize the assemblage elements in a qualitative sense.  Each of the four categories should be completed with none, some, many, or all as applicable.  "Major" and "minor" refer to clast or particle size relative to the size of the body, not to morphological or taxonomic importance.

<ul>
<li>articulated whole bodies - vertebrate teeth, brachiopod and bivalve valves, crinoid
<li>disarticulated, associated major elements
<li>disassociated major elements: 
<li>disassociated minor elements
</ul>
