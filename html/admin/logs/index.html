<H3>Notes about these statistics:</H3>

<UL>
<LI>The difference between the members and everyone statistics should be taken as an approximation, not an exact count.  It's hard to exclude everyone except members accurately.</LI>
<LI>Images, .js (JavaScripts), and .css (Cascading Style Sheets) are counted in the hit totals for the everyone page, but are not listed in the URL section.  For the members page, they are hidden and ignored.</LI>
<LI>All NCEAS domains are ignored (ie, not counted).</LI>
<LI>Pages referred by paleodb.org, pbdb.org, or flatpebble are not listed in the referrers section.</LI>
<LI>Check the modification time at the top of each log page to see how recent it is.</LI>
