=head2 DESCRIPTION

This page describes the usage of taxonomic names in this data service.  It describes the
parameters that are used to specify taxonomic names in query operations, and the modifiers that
can be applied to taxonomic names in order to precisely specify a portion of the tree of life.

=head2 PARAMETERS

Many of the data service operations allow you to specify taxonomic names as parameter values.  All of
these operations, e.g. L<node:taxa/list> and L<node:occs/list>, allow you to specify a taxon or set of taxa
via one of three parameters:

=over

=item taxon_name

Selects all records corresponding to a I<single taxon>.  If the parameter value matches more than one
taxononomic name in the database, either because it is a homonym or because you used
L<wildcards|#ABBREVIATIONS AND WILDCARDS>,
then the taxon with the most occurrences in the database will be selected by default.
If you are not getting the taxon you intended, you can either add more letters (i.e. abbreviate
less) or use a L<selector|#SELECTORS> (see below).

=item base_name

Selects all records corresponding to a I<single taxon plus all of its subtaxa>.  If the parameter
value matches more than one taxonomic name in the database, either because it is a homonym or because
you used wildcards, then the taxon with the most occurrences in the database will be selected by
default.

=item match_name

Selects all records corresponding to all I<matching taxa>, where the matching is alphabetic rather
than taxonomic.  If the parameter value matches more
than one taxonomic name in the database, all will be selected.  Subtaxa will not be included; if
you wish to get subtaxa, you can pick out from the result the name or names you are interested in
and do a second query using the C<base_name> parameter.

=back

If you use the C<taxon_name> parameter, you get back a list of
occurrences identified to that taxon specifically, and not to any subtaxon.  For example, the
following query shows just occurrences that are identified as I<Stegosauridae>, without any genus
or species identification:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?rowcount&taxon_name=Stegosauridae>

=back

If, on the other hand, you use the C<base_name> parameter, you get back a list of occurrences
identified to that taxon inclusive of any subtaxa.  Note that the following result contains many
more occurrences.  The additional ones are identified as belonging to particular species or genera
within the Stegosauridae.

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?rowcount&base_name=Stegosauridae>

=back

You can always include more than one taxon name, separated by commas.  The resulting list will
include all records that match any of the names.  For example:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?rowcount&base_name=Dacentrurus, Loricatosaurus>

=back

The same parameters can be used with the L<node:taxa/list> operation.  For example, the
following query returns all of the taxa within I<Stegosauridae> that have been entered into this
database:

=over

=item *

L<op:taxa/list.txt?rowcount&base_name=Stegosauridae>

=back

Finally, if you are not sure of the exact spelling of the name you are interested in, you
can abbreviate and get a list of all matching names:

=over

=item *

L<op:taxa/list.txt?rowcount&show=class&match_name=Stegos.>

=back

To narrow down the search, you can use a selector to indicate what part of the tree of
life you wish to search in:

=over

=item *

L<op:taxa/list.txt?rowcount&show=class&match_name=insecta:stegos.>

=back

Finally, note that all name matching is case insensitive.

=head2 MODIFIERS

There are two kinds of modifiers that you can apply to any taxonomic name.  You can use them in
any combination.

=head3 EXCLUSIONS

The first kind of modifier is used to exclude subtaxa.  A name using this kind of modifier looks
like:

    Name ^Exclusion

An exclusion must match a subtaxon of the name it modifies.  You can add as many exclusions as you
like, and you can either separate them with a space or not as you choose.  For example, the
following query will show all of the occurrences of I<Stegosauridae> except those in the genera
I<Stegosaurus> and I<Kentrosaurus>:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Stegosauridae ^Stegosaurus ^Kentrosaurus>

=back

As another example, the following query will tabulate the diversity of the non-avian dinosaur genera of
North America over time:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/diversity.txt?base_name=Dinosauria^Aves&continent=NOA>

=back

=head3 SELECTORS

The second kind of modifier is used to differentiate between homonyms.  A name using
this kind of modifier looks like:

    Selector:Name

The selector should be the first few letters (3 or more) of any taxon enclosing the one you are interested in.
For example, any of the following queries will return all of the occurrences of I<Ficus>, the genus of
sea snails:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Gastropoda:Ficus>

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Gastro:Ficus>

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Mollusc:Ficus>

=back

On the other hand, either of the following queries will return all of the occurrences of I<Ficus>, the genus
of land plants:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Plant:Ficus>

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Moraceae:Ficus>

=back

If you use a name which is a homonym and do not specify any selector, then the taxon which has the
most occurrences in the database will be selected by default.

=head3 ABBREVIATIONS AND WILDCARDS

You can abbreviate any taxon name by ending it with a period.  When specifying a binomial, you can
abbreviate the genus down to one letter in the usual way, or you can specify more letters.  You can
also use the standard SQL wildcards:

=over

=item C<%>

Matches any sequence of characters.  Equivalent to a period.

=item C<_>

Matches any single character.

=back

For example, any of the following queries will show all of the occurrences of I<Tyrannosaurus rex>:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=T.rex>

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Tyr. rex>

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Ty% rex>

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Tyr% r_x>

=back

The most important thing to remember about abbreviations is that if your abbreviation matches more
than one taxon, the selected taxon will be whichever one has the most occurrences in the
database.  For example, the following query will actually show all of the occurrences of the coral
I<Tarbellastraea reussiana>, which is the matching taxon with the most occurrences:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=T. re.>

=back

If you are getting a different taxon than you intended, you can either use more letters or add a
selector:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=dino:T. re.>

=back

As another example, the following query will show all of the occurrences of I<Tyrannosauroidea>,
which is the largest taxon in the database matching the name I<Tyrann.> :

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?base_name=Tyrann.>

=back

In order to see which taxon is being matched, you can use the L<taxa/single|node:taxa/single> operation, as
follows:

=over

=item *

L<op:taxa/single.txt?taxon_name=Tyrann.>

=back

For a completely different example, the following query will return all of the occurrences of the B<insect>
species I<Tyrannasorus rex>:

=over

=item *

L<op:occs/list.txt?show=class&base_name=insect:t.rex>

=back
