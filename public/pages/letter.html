      <p>This message is to clarify the situation with the Paleobiology Database. After John Alroy moved to Australia, the most recent and current Paleobiology Database NSF grant was transferred to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where a new server was later installed. Late in 2012, John informed the Executive Committee and others in the community that he was contemplating leaving the PaleoDB because the workload was too great. Following lengthy discussions, in June John emailed Executive Committee, the Advisory Board, and others associated with the PaleoDB, stating that he would leave the database and create Fossilworks, which would be dedicated to analytical tools.
      <br><br>
      Since that time, there have been points of tension between John Alroy and the Executive Committee and Advisory Board about implementing the transition. Unfortunately, these points of tension have come to a head. The breaking issue is that John Alroy wants to limit PaleoDB to simple search functions, and a database of this nature cannot function without a more powerful set of tools.
      <br><br>
      John Alroy brought Fossilworks online several weeks ago, separating data entry functions from download and analysis. Data entered at the Madison-based server (at our new url <a href="http://paleobiodb.org">paleobiodb.org</a>), can be downloaded there and is sent nightly to Fossilworks where it can also be accessed. However, while Fossilworks also accepts data entry, it currently does not transmit that data to the PaleoDB main server in Madison. As a consequence, downloads from the two sites may differ, which could be a serious problem going forward. The Madison team includes several programmers who are working to develop additional visualization and analysis tools and to take advantage of developing opportunities by linking with external databases and web services relevant to paleontological research (e.g., GPlates, GBIF, EOL, Neotoma).
      <br><br>
      Enterers should continue to enter data into the primary server, now at <a href="http://paleobiodb.org">paleobiodb.org</a> in Madison, which will be served to Fossilworks. More importantly, it will be accessible for a wide range of visualization and analysis tools being developed by the IT team and will be available to the broadest user base. Many members of the Executive Committee and Advisory Board will be at GSA, SVP, Palass, and other upcoming meetings; please feel free talk to us (or send us an email) about these developments and the exciting future.
