<h3>Paleobiology Database Intensive Summer Course in Analytical Paleobiology</h3>

The Paleobiology Database is sponsoring an intensive course in analytical paleobiology that will be held at <a href="www.nceas.ucsb.edu">the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</a>. The course will take place between Wednesday, July 6th and Tuesday, August 2nd 2005.<p>

<i>Applications for the course are no longer being accepted. However, we hope to offer the course again in 2006, so the following information may be of interest.</i><p>

Topics will include community paleoecology, quantitative biostratigraphy, speciation and extinction, morphometrics, and phylogenetics. Both simulation modelling and data analysis methods will be explored. The course will combine lectures and labs, and students will be given hands-on instruction in programming and the use of analytical software. In addition to the course coordinator, each week a new instructor will be present. Participating instructors are expected to include <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~alroy">John Alroy</a>, <a href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ceb/faculty/Foote.html">Michael Foote</a>, <a href="http://www.trilobyte.ucr.edu">Nigel Hughes</a>, <a href="http://www.geosc.psu.edu/people/faculty/personalpages/mpatz/index.html">Mark Patzkowsky</a>, <a href="http://pjw3.fmnh.org">Pete Wagner</a>, and <a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/webster.shtml">Mark Webster</a>.<p>

There is no fee for registration. Travel and housing expenses will be defrayed. Participating students should be in the early stages of their own research in paleontology and should have a background in basic statistics. The course is open to all students, but first or second year graduate students are encouraged to apply, as are international students.<p>

Applications should be submitted in electronic form to John Alroy (alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu) no later than February 15th. Applications should consist of a one page statement plus a recommendation letter written by the student's academic advisor. No form needs to be filled out. The statement should include a description of current research plans, a list of relevant classes taken and degrees earned, and an account of the student's background in statistics and programming.<p>

Note: although graduate students will be given priority, we will consider applications from older researchers.
If there is enough interest, we may consider organizing a short course at a later date for advanced students and Ph.D.s.<p>
