<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>
This is a <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=OSA">Paleobiology Database Online Systematics Archive</a> Archive compiled by G. D. Webster.  It includes  classification and alpha taxonomy of Paleozoic  crinoids, coronates and hemistreptocrinids.
</p>

<h3>Scientific goals</h3>

<p>
The synonymies are used to update and correct the faunal data.  Hopefully, as the data base is built it will be of significant use for various studies of taxa and faunas.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
The data base includes information for all illustrated and described Paleozoic species since 1759.  Initial unpublished compilation of the alpha taxonomy was undertaken by Frank Springer prior to his death in 1926.  The Springer file (typed by his daughter Ada) was updated and published by Ray Bassler and Margaret Moodey (1943).  Supplements to the Bassler and Moodey volume were made by Webster (1973, 1977, 1986, 1988, 1993).  Between 1990 and 2000 Webster integrated his supplements with the Bassler and Moodey work and made a search for all previously missed publications.  The missed publications were then integrated and the total compilation published (Webster, 2003) online by the Geological Society of America as Special Paper 363.
</p>

<p>
The basic higher taxonomic classification for these echinoderms follows the Treatise (Moore and Teichert, 1978) with numerous revisions and emendations by subsequent workers (Simms and Sevastopuo, 1993; Ausich, 1998; Webster and Jell, 1999; Webster and Kues, 2006; among many others).  Synonymies in the index (Webster, 2003 and earlier compilations) are based on the work of the individual publications cited and may or may not reflect the personal views of me.  Notations were made for some synonymies where I strongly disagree.  A few synonymies were corrected when recognized to be in error.
</p>

<p>
A separate bibliography was included in each of the Webster compilations for the years covered by each publication.  Special Paper 363 includes publications from 1759 through 1999 that illustrated or described taxa as well as nonsystematic publications that discuss or have implications that could be of significance in the study of Paleozoic crinoids, coronates and hemistreptacrinids.
</p>

<p>
The post 1999 literature is currently being compiled to integrate to the earlier compilations.
