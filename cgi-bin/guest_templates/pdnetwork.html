<hr><b>Name</b>: The Paleobiology Database<p>

<hr><b>Home page URL</b>: <a href="http://paleodb.org/">http://paleodb.org/</a><p>

<hr><b>Purpose</b>: To provide the public and the paleontological research community with  collection-level information on the spatial, temporal, and environmental distribution of fossils, as well as images and taxonomic accounts of fossils and web-based scripts for analyzing large-scale patterns in these data. In the future, phylogenetic and morphometric data also will be collected and provided freely on the web. Any professional paleontologist may volunteer to become a contributor to the database. See also our <a href="%%read_url%%?action=displayPage&page=paleodbFAQ">FAQ</a> page.<p>

<hr><b>Scope</b>: The global Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic fossil record of marine and terrestrial animal and plant life.<p>

<hr><b>Intended audience</b>: Everyone, and especially professional paleontologists.<p>

<hr><b>Platform/software</b>: Housed in a MySQL database on an Apple Xserve dual-processor, four-hard drive server. Software development is performed on a Dell PowerEdge 1300 dual-processor server.<p>

<hr><b>Data model</b>: The database currently includes seven major, interconnected tables:
<ol>
<li>References.
<li>Collections (including geographic, stratigraphic, paleoenvironmental, taphonomic, and collecting method data). Keyed to references.
<li>Occurrences (i.e., instances of taxa occuring within collections, plus abundances). Keyed to references and collections.
<li>Reidentifications (i.e., taxonomic changes to previously published occurrences). Keyed to references and occurrences.
<li>Taxonomic authorities (i.e., who named what when). Keyed to references.
<li>Taxonomic opinions (i.e., who classified what within what, or synonymized what with what, when). Keyed to references and authorities.
<li>Images (i.e., an index of binary image files representing fossils). Keyed to authorities.
</ol>

We are currently implementing tables that will record phylogeny, morphometrics, and taphonomic and paleoecologic data regarding individual taxa, occurrences, and specimens.<p>

<hr><b>Terminology conventions for data entry</b>: Please see our <a
href="javascript: tipsPopup('/public/tips/tips.html');">tip sheets</a>.<p>

<hr><b>Output query system</b>: Analysis and query of data sets is performed using custom CGI scripts written in Perl, Javascript, and C++ that employ standard SQL syntax.<p>

<hr><b>Available user support</b>: The database employs a full-time <!-- programmer and --> database manager who is responsible for technical support.
We maintain extensive <a href="javascript: tipsPopup('/public/tips/tips.html');">tip sheets</a> that show how to enter data using our web-based data entry forms.<p>

<hr><b>Date of establishment</b>: August, 1998 (Phanerozoic Marine Paleofaunal Database); September, 2000 (current database, including the PMPD).<p>

<hr><b>Location</b>: The database server and main office are housed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a unit of the University of California, Santa Barbara.<p>

<hr><b>Institutional and financial support</b>: Supported by a Biocomplexity grant from NSF from September, 2000 through August, 2005.<p>

<hr><b>Long-term maintenance plans</b>: The database will continue to be housed and maintained at NCEAS through the duration of the grant.
It is intended to become a permanent resource for the community.<p>
