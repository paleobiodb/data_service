<i>The deadline for applications for the 2006 summer course has now passed, and further applications will not be considered. The following is a draft announcement for the 2007 course. The deadline (normally during February or March), exact dates during the summer (normally around July), and instructor list have not been decided yet. The course may or may not be offered depending on logistical factors.</i>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://paleodb.org">The Paleobiology Database</a> hopes to sponsor a four-week intensive course in analytical paleobiology that will be held at the <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu">National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</a> at the University of California, Santa Barbara. If possible, the course will take place in the summer of 2007.
</p>

<p>
Topics will include community paleoecology, quantitative biostratigraphy, diversity curves, speciation and extinction, morphometrics, and phylogenetics. Both simulation modelling and data analysis methods will be explored. The course will combine lectures and labs, and students will be given hands-on instruction in programming and the use of analytical software, with an emphasis on R. In addition to the course coordinator, each week a new instructor will be present. Participating instructors may include <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~alroy">John Alroy</a>, <a href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ceb/faculty/Foote.html">Michael Foote</a>, <a href="http://www.trilobyte.ucr.edu">Nigel Hughes</a>, <a href="http://www.geosc.psu.edu/people/faculty/personalpages/mpatz/index.html">Mark Patzkowsky</a>, <a href="http://pjw3.fmnh.org">Pete Wagner</a>, and <a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/webster.shtml">Mark Webster</a>.<p>
</p>

<p>
There is no fee for registration, and students will be housed for free in apartments on the UCSB campus. Students are urged to apply for travel funds from their home institutions. If such funds are not available, travel expenses of up to $400 may be reimbursed. If more is needed, then the advisor must provide a specific statement that institutional funds are not available and the student has unusual financial need. Students are responsible for meal expenses. Additional funding for meal expenses for students from outside of the United States, Canada, and Western Europe may be provided, again depending on need. There are no other charges of any kind, and no other major expenses are likely.
</p>

<p>
Participating students should be in the early stages of their own research in paleontology. They should have a background in basic statistics, and preferably also programming. The course is open to undergraduates and advanced graduate students, but first or second year graduate students are particularly encouraged to apply. We also strongly encourage applications from women, minorities, and international students. Applications from professionals who have completed their studies will be considered, but strong preference will be given to students.
</p>

<p>
Applications should be submitted in PDF format to John Alroy (alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu) no later than the end of the day on the due date. Applications should consist of a one page statement. Do not include separate documents such as a curriculum vitae. No form needs to be filled out. The statement should include a brief description of current research plans, a list of degrees earned stating the year of graduation in each case, a list of relevant classes taken, and an account of the student's background in statistics and programming. Applicants are encouraged to explain why the topics addressed by the course are of special interest to them, and which of these subjects are taught at their home institutions.
</p>

<p>
Applications must be accompanied by a recommendation letter, also in PDF format, written by the student's academic advisor and e-mailed separately. Obtaining a recommendation from anyone who is not an advisor must be explained. It is very important that the recommendation give details about the applicant's personal character and abilities, not just credentials and research projects. Recommendation letters also must be received by the end of the due date.
