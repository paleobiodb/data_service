<h3>Paleobiology Database Intensive Summer Course in Analytical Paleobiology</h3>
</center>

<div align="left">

<a href="http://paleodb.org">The Paleobiology Database</a> is sponsoring an intensive course in analytical paleobiology that will be held at the <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu">National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</a> at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The course will take place between Tuesday, June 27th and Monday, July 24th 2006.<p>

Topics will include community paleoecology, quantitative biostratigraphy, diversity curves, speciation and extinction, morphometrics, and phylogenetics. Both simulation modelling and data analysis methods will be explored. The course will combine lectures and labs, and students will be given hands-on instruction in programming and the use of analytical software, with an emphasis on R. In addition to the course coordinator, each week a new instructor will be present. Participating instructors are expected to include <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~alroy">John Alroy</a>, <a href="http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ceb/faculty/Foote.html">Michael Foote</a>, <a href="http://www.trilobyte.ucr.edu">Nigel Hughes</a>, <a href="http://www.geosc.psu.edu/people/faculty/personalpages/mpatz/index.html">Mark Patzkowsky</a>, <a href="http://pjw3.fmnh.org">Pete Wagner</a>, and <a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/webster.shtml">Mark Webster</a>.<p>

There is no fee for registration, and students will be housed for free in apartments on the UCSB campus. Students are urged to apply for travel funds from their home institutions. If such funds are not available, all travel expenses beyond the first $400 will be reimbursed completely, regardless of the country of origin. Students are responsible for meal expenses. Additional funding for students from outside of the United States, Canada, and Western Europe may be provided. There are no other charges of any kind, and no other major expenses are likely.<p>

Participating students should be in the early stages of their own research in paleontology. They should have a background in basic statistics, and preferably also programming. The course is open to all students, but first or second year graduate students are particularly encouraged to apply, as are international students. Applications from professionals who have completed their studies will be considered, but strong preference will be given to students.<p>

Applications should be submitted in PDF form to John Alroy (alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu) no later than March 1st. Applications should consist of a one page statement, plus a recommendation letter written by the student's academic advisor and e-mailed separately. Do not include separate documents such as a curriculum vitae. No form needs to be filled out. The statement should include a description of current research plans, a list of relevant classes taken and degrees earned, and an account of the student's background in statistics and programming.  Applicants are encouraged to explain why the topics addressed by the course are of special interest to them, and which of these subjects are taught at their home institutions.<p>
