<div class="title">Decapod Database</div>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>
This is a <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=OSA">Paleobiology Database Online Systematics Archive</a> including classification and alpha taxonomy of decapod crustaceans (shrimps, lobsters, crabs).  The occurrences in this database are largely derived from NSF-funded projects of Rodney M. Feldmann and Carrie E. Schweitzer and include occurrences in the Southern Hemisphere, especially Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, and Antarctica; the Central Americas, especially Baja California Sur, Mexico; and northern and eastern Europe, especially Romania.  In addition, classification and occurrence information is added for fossil decapods worldwide as the data become available.  Every attempt is made to enter the complete systematic placement of each taxon, but this an ongoing process.  All of the entered data are derived from published, peer-reviewed journal articles, monographs, or book chapters.
</p>

<h3>Scientific goals</h3>

<p>
The goals are to provide up-to-date, verified taxonomic information on the decapod crustaceans, a perhaps less well-studied group in the fossil record despite the relative common occurrence of the fossils.  In addition, as more information is added, paleobiogeographic distributions can be plotted with ease as can diversity patterns over time at a variety of taxonomic levels.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
Feldmann has 40 years of experience and publication record working with fossil decapod crustaceans, and Schweitzer has a decade's worth of the same.  Entry of the data began in 2004 and includes publications generated by NSF funding since that time.  Data entry is ongoing.
