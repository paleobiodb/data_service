<div class="title">Tertiary South American Mammals</div>

<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>
This is a <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=OSA">Paleobiology Database Online Systematics Archive</a> that includes historical and current taxonomy and classification data for Tertiary South American mammals.  These data accompany an expanding set of occurrence records with an emphasis on Oligo-Miocene localities.
</p>

<h3>Scientific goals</h3>

<p>
This dataset is in the process of being completed but will eventually include all published Tertiary occurrences of mammals in South America.  It is primarily intended to provide a framework for investigations into the biogeography and evolution of endemic South American mammals.  It is also intended to serve as an easily accessible database of current taxonomic and systematic information for anyone interested in these groups.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
Entry of these data began in 2004 and is an ongoing process.
