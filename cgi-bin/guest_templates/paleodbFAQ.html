<b>What is the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
The Paleobiology Database is a public resource for the scientific community.
It has been organized and operated by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional group of paleobiological researchers.
Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic data for marine and terrestrial animals and plants of any geological age, as well as web-based software for statistical analysis of the data.
The project's wider, long-term goal is to encourage collaborative efforts to answer large-scale paleobiological questions by developing a useful database infrastructure and bringing together large data sets.
<p>

<a name="contents"></a>
<b>What data are now in the Database?</b><br>
Please see our <a href="$exec_url?action=displayPage&page=coverage">generalized table of spatiotemporal coverage</a>.
We also maintain a list of <a href="$exec_url?action=displayPage&page=datasets">major individual data sets</a> that have been reposited in the Database.<p>

<a name="structure"></a>
<b>What is the database structure?</b><br>
The Database currently includes four main tables: references, primary collection data, taxonomic occurrences, and reidentifications of occurrences. The tables are tied together with record ID numbers. The reference, occurrence, and reidentification tables are relatively simple; the collection table has many fields that are described on a separate <a href="$exec_url?action=displayPage&page=structure1">database structure</a> page.
We are working to add tables that will handle taxonomic authority information and taxonomic opinions (e.g., synonymies).
At a later date we will add tables to handle phylogenetic relationships, ecomorphological attributes, stratigraphic sections, radioisotopic age estimates, and other data.
<p>

<a name="funding"></a>
<b>How is the Paleobiology Database funded?</b><br>
The Paleobiology Database is currently funded by a five-year grant from the National Science Foundation's Biocomplexity program.
<p>

<a name="organization"></a>
<b>How is the Database organized?</b><br>
The Database has a main office at NCEAS that is staffed by <a href="mailto:alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu">John Alroy</a>, the Database coordinator.
<!-- The Database has a main office at NCEAS that is staffed by <a href="mailto:alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu">John Alroy</a> (Database coordinator) and <a href="mailto:@nceas.ucsb.edu"></a> (systems developer and database manager). -->
The Database includes six research groups and many individual data contributors, and also serves as a repository for the Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems database and Paleogeographic Atlas Project.
General issues are discussed by an Advisory Board that meets once a year and communicates over an e-mail list.<p>

<a name="board"></a>
<b>How is the Advisory Board organized?</b><br>
Currently, the Board consists of 15 members. Three are ex officio; they are the members of the Steering Committee. One member is drawn from each of the six working groups. Six at large members are drawn from the entire pool of Database authorizers. Each year two working group members and two at large members are rotated off the Board, with the working groups choosing replacements and the remaining 11 members choosing the two new at large members. Terms are three years long, and members may serve multiple consecutive terms. <!-- One member of the Board will serve as a liason to the Paleontological Society. -->
The current members of Board members are J. Alroy, W. Clyde, F. F&uuml;rsich, P. Gensel, M. Kowalewski, C. Marshall, A. Miller, H. Sims, D. Smith, M. Uhen, and P. Wagner.
The members from 2000 through 2003 were J. Alroy, R. Bambach, M. Foote, F. F&uuml;rsich, S. Holland, L. Ivany, D. Jablonski, S. Lidgard, C. Marshall, A. Miller, T. Olszewski, M. Patzkowsky, K. Roy, H. Sims, P. Wagner, and S. Wing.<p>

<a name="history"></a>
<b>How did the Database come into existence?</b><br>
The Paleobiology Database originated in the <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">NCEAS</a>-funded Phanerozoic Marine Paleofaunal Database initiative, which operated from August 1998 through August 2000.
It currently is funded by an NSF Biocomplexity grant.<p>

<a name="participants"></a>
<b>Who is currently participating in the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
Please see our <a href="$exec_url?action=displayPage&page=participants">participants</a> web page.<p>

<a name="membership"></a>
<b>Who can join the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
Database membership is open to all professional researchers who agree to abide by Database policy and contribute a significant amount of data.
There is no charge for membership or any other service provided by the Database.
By "professional," we normally mean trained at a graduate level in paleontology: more than 95% of our contributors have a Ph.D., and the others have master's degrees.
We also expect that contributors will work largely independently of any academic supervisor, as opposed to using data collected by a supervisor.
If you don't fit these criteria but do want to contribute, you might consider entering data under the authorization of a formal Database member who is in your local area.
No formal procedure needs to be followed to become a data enterer.
Please see our <a href="$exec_url?action=displayPage&page=participants">list of members</a> for contact information.
If you do wish to join as an independent contributor, please write to <a href="mailto:alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu">the database coordinator</a>.<p>

<a name="groups"></a>
<b>How can I form a research group within the Database?</b><br>
Database contributors may form research groups of two or more members. The purpose of a group is to facilitate sharing of otherwise private data by researchers who are collaborating on a study.
If you are a contributor, you may form a group or add members to a group at any time, without having to obtain permission from anyone.
Just write the database coordinator stating the name of the group and its members. Conversely, the Database will not add members to your group unless you want us to, even when researchers working in related areas independently join the Database.<p>

<a name="ownership"></a>
<b>Who has access to the data?</b><br>
We encourage making all contributed data publicly accessible. However, all data sets entered into our system may be protected so that they are not viewable either by any other users (your private data) or by anyone outside of your research group (your group data). Protection is limited for up to two years after date of entry for previously published data, and up to five years for unpublished data.
Your own password will allow you to view research group-readable data belonging to any group that includes you.
Protected data cannot be accessed by any of our scripts or in any other way unless the appropriate password is provided. The only exception is the reference search script, which needs to access all the references because we need to avoid duplicate entry of published data.<p>

<a name="upload"></a>
<b>Can I upload data into the Database?</b><br>
We are happy to accept paleontological data files for upload. However, we do have some criteria that must be met first. Specifically, all of the following should be true:<p>

<ul>
<li class="medium"> The contributor already is a PBDB member, or the Advisory Board has approved making the contributor a member after discussing the proposed upload.
<li class="medium"> The data already are in electronic form.
<li class="medium"> Entering the data by hand into the PBDB simply wasn't possible.
<li class="medium"> The data include most, if not necessarily all, of our key fields (e.g., for a collection record we'd like country, lat/long, period, reference).
<li class="medium"> A good-faith effort has been made to get the data into PBDB format.
<li class="medium"> A good-faith effort has been made to identify and remove data that replicate existing PBDB data.
<li class="medium"> The contributor intends to maintain and augment the data on our system using our software, or else the contributor has no plans to do this on any system.
</ul><p>

<a name="officialPDpublications"></a>
<b>What is considered an official Paleobiology Database publication?</b><br class="medium">
We consider any paper to be an official publication if: (a) it uses data taken from the Database; (b) it results from research conducted as part of a Database research group meeting; or (c) it results from research conducted while the author was funded by the Database.
Because we maintain a <a href="$exec_url?action=displayPage&page=publications">list</a> of such publications, please notify us as soon as any such paper is accepted for publication and the final version is ready to be sent out.
We will then give the publication a number and add it to the list.
We ask that you acknowledge the Database by adding a line to your paper saying "This is Paleobiology Database publication #..."<p>

<a name="electronicPDpublications"></a>
<b>Are contributed data sets electronic publications?</b><br>
Yes: contributors may consider their contributed data sets to be electronic publications. We maintain a <a href="$exec_url?action=displayPage&page=datasets">web page</a> listing all such data sets. Simply write the database coordinator a letter saying that you consider a certain block of data to be a publication, and then giving a title and list of authors. Of course, electronic publications on this list can refer only to publicly released data.<p>

<a name="citations"></a>
<b>How should the data be cited?</b><br>
You can cite the Database in either of two ways. First, you can cite the specific electronic publication that you used (see above). Second, you can refer to a specific download from the Paleobiology Database, giving the date and parameters of the download. Here is an example:<p>
<i>"The data were downloaded from the Paleobiology Database on 31 December, 2000, using the group name 'marine' and the following parameters: time intervals = Carboniferous and Permian, region = Europe, paleoenvironment = marine, class = Bivalvia."</i><p>
