<b>What is the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
The Paleobiology Database is a public resource for the global scientific community.
It has been organized and operated by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, international group of paleobiological researchers.
Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic data for marine and terrestrial animals and plants of any geological age, as well as web-based software for statistical analysis of the data.
The project's wider, long-term goal is to encourage collaborative efforts to answer large-scale paleobiological questions by developing a useful database infrastructure and bringing together large data sets.
<p>

<a name="contents"></a>
<b>What data are now in the Database?</b><br>
Please see our <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=coverage">generalized table of spatiotemporal coverage</a>.
We also maintain a list of <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=datasets">major individual data sets</a> that have been reposited in the Database.<p>

<a name="structure"></a>
<b>What is the database structure?</b><br>
The Database currently includes nine main tables: published references, taxonomic names, taxonomic synonymies and classifications, primary collection data, taxonomic occurrences, reidentifications of occurrences, and three tables describing geological time scales.
Additional scientific tables track ecological and taphonomic attributes of higher taxa and species, measurements of specimens, and data about the digital fossil images on the site.
There are also a number of bookkeeping tables.
The tables are tied together relationally with record ID numbers.
At a later date we may add tables to handle phylogenetic relationships, ecomorphological attributes, stratigraphic sections, radioisotopic age estimates, and other data.
<p>

<a name="funding"></a>
<b>How is the Paleobiology Database funded?</b><br>
The Paleobiology Database is currently funded by a five-year grant from the National Science Foundation's Biocomplexity program that ends in August, 2006; a separate grant from the NSF Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology program; and grants to individual Database members.
We are confident of our ability to obtain long-term funding.
<p>

<a name="organization"></a>
<b>How is the Database organized?</b><br>
The Database has a main office at NCEAS that houses <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=personnel">John Alroy</a>, the Database coordinator, and  <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=personnel">Peter Schroeter</a>, the Database software developer and database manager.
Backups of the data are reposited permanently at five different institutions.
The Database includes five <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=working_groups">working groups</a>, several other research groups, and many individual data contributors, and also serves as a repository for the Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems database and Paleogeographic Atlas Project.
General issues are discussed by an Advisory Board that meets once a year and communicates over an e-mail list.<p>

<a name="board"></a>
<b>How is the Advisory Board organized?</b><br>
Currently, the Board consists of 16 members. Six are ex officio; they are the members of the Steering Committee. One member is drawn from each of the five working groups. Five at large members are drawn from the entire pool of Database authorizers. Each year three members are rotated off the Board, with the working groups choosing replacements to represent them and the remaining members choosing the new at large members. Terms are three years long, and members may serve multiple consecutive terms. <!-- One member of the Board will serve as a liason to the Paleontological Society. -->
The past and current Board members are:<p>

<a name="history"></a>
<b>How did the Database come into existence?</b><br>
The Paleobiology Database originated in the <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">NCEAS</a>-funded Phanerozoic Marine Paleofaunal Database initiative, which operated from August 1998 through August 2000.
Since then, it has been funded primarily by the National Science Foundation.
<p>

<a name="participants"></a>
<b>Who is currently participating in the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
Please see our <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=participants">participants</a> web page.<p>

<a name="membership"></a>
<b>Who can join the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
Database membership is open to all professional researchers who agree to abide by Database policy and contribute a significant amount of data.
There is no charge for membership or any other service provided by the Database.
Conversely, the Database will not make payments to receive existing data sets.
By "professional," we normally mean trained at a graduate level in paleontology: more than 95% of our contributors have a Ph.D., and the others have master's degrees.
We also expect that contributors will work largely independently of any academic supervisor, as opposed to using data collected by a supervisor.
If you don't fit these criteria but do want to contribute, you might consider entering data under the authorization of a formal Database member who is in your local area.
No formal procedure needs to be followed to become a data enterer.
Please see our <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=participants">list of members</a> for contact information.
If you do wish to join as an independent contributor, please see our <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=join_us">guidelines for joining the Database</a> and then write to <a href="mailto:alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu">the database coordinator</a>.<p>

<a name="working_groups"></a>
<b>What is a Paleobiology Database working group?</b><br>
The Database organizes "working groups" of database contributors that collaborate on large-scale, long-term research projects.
See our <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=working_groups">working group page</a> for details.<p>

<a name="research_groups"></a>
<b>What is a research group, and how can I form one?</b><br>
In addition to working groups, the Database also includes less formal research groups.
The purpose of a research group is to facilitate sharing of otherwise private data by researchers who are collaborating on a study.
If you are a contributor, you may form a group or add members to a group at any time, without having to obtain permission from anyone.
Just write the database coordinator stating the name of the group and its members. Conversely, the Database will not add members to your group unless you want us to, even when researchers working in related areas independently join the Database.<p>

<a name="ownership"></a>
<b>Who has access to the data?</b><br>
We encourage making all contributed data publicly accessible. However, all faunal and floral data sets entered into our system may be protected so that they are not viewable either by any other users (your private data) or by anyone outside of your research group (your group data). Protection is limited for up to two years after date of entry for previously published data, and up to five years for unpublished data.
Your own password will allow you to view research group-readable data belonging to any group that includes you.
Protected data cannot be accessed by any of our scripts or in any other way unless the appropriate password is provided. The only exceptions are the reference search and taxonomy scripts, which need to access all the reference and taxonomy data because there is little subjective interpretation and we need to avoid duplicate entry of published data.<p>

<a name="upload"></a>
<b>Can I upload data into the Database?</b><br>
We are happy to accept paleontological data files for upload. However, we do have some criteria that must be met first. Specifically, all of the following should be true:<p>

<ul>
<li class="medium"> The contributor already is a PBDB member, or the Advisory Board has approved making the contributor a member after discussing the proposed upload.
<li class="medium"> The data already are in electronic form.
<li class="medium"> Entering the data by hand into the PBDB would be extremely time consuming.
<li class="medium"> The data include most, if not necessarily all, of our key fields (e.g., for a collection record we'd like country, lat/long, period, reference).
<li class="medium"> A good-faith effort has been made to get the data into PBDB format.
<li class="medium"> A good-faith effort has been made to identify and remove data that replicate existing PBDB data.
<li class="medium"> The contributor intends to maintain and augment the data on our system using our software, or else the contributor has no plans to do this on any system.
</ul><p>

<p>Please see our <a href="javascript: tipsPopup('/public/tips/upload_tips.html')">data upload tip sheet</a>.</p>

<a name="officialPDpublications"></a>
<b>What is considered an official Paleobiology Database publication?</b><br class="medium">
We consider any paper to be an official publication if: (a) it uses data taken from the Database; (b) it results from research conducted as part of a Database research group meeting; or (c) it results from research conducted while the author was funded by the Database.
Because we maintain a <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=publications">list</a> of such publications, please notify us as soon as any such paper is accepted for publication and the final version is ready to be sent out.
We will then give the publication a number and add it to the list.
We ask that you acknowledge the Database by adding a line to your paper saying "This is Paleobiology Database publication #..."<p>

<a name="electronicPDpublications"></a>
<b>Are contributed data sets electronic publications?</b><br>
Yes: contributors may consider their contributed data sets to be electronic publications. We maintain a <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=datasets">web page</a> listing all such data sets. Simply write the database coordinator a letter saying that you consider a certain block of data to be a publication, and then giving a title and list of authors. Of course, electronic publications on this list can refer only to publicly released data.<p>

<a name="citations"></a>
<b>How should the data be cited?</b><br>
You can cite the Database in either of two ways. First, you can cite the specific electronic publication that you used (see above). Second, you can refer to a specific download from the Paleobiology Database, giving the date and parameters of the download. Here is an example:<p>
<i>"The data were downloaded from the Paleobiology Database on 31 December, 2000, using the group name 'marine' and the following parameters: time intervals = Carboniferous and Permian, region = Europe, paleoenvironment = marine, class = Bivalvia."</i><p>
