<b>What is the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
<span class="small">
The Paleobiology Database is a public resource for the global scientific community.
It has been organized and operated by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, international group of paleobiological researchers.
Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic data for marine and terrestrial animals and plants of any geological age, as well as web-based software for statistical analysis of the data.
The project's wider, long-term goal is to encourage collaborative efforts to answer large-scale paleobiological questions by developing a useful database infrastructure and bringing together large data sets.
</span>
</p>

<a name="contents"></a>
<p>
<b>What data are now in the Database?</b><br>
<span class="small">
We maintain full descriptions of each of our <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&amp;action=displayPage&amp;page=OSA">Online Systematics Archives</a>.
You can also see what we know about the taxonomy of a group by <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&amp;action=startStartPrintHierarchy">generating a classification</a>.
It's easy to tell what collection and occurrence data are in the Database by generating  <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&amp;action=displayReportForm">data summary tables</a>.
For example, you can get counts of fossil collections within geological periods, or by continent.
</span>
</p>

<a name="structure"></a>
<p>
<b>What is the database structure?</b><br>
<span class="small">
The Database currently includes nine main tables: published references, taxonomic names, taxonomic synonymies and classifications, primary collection data, taxonomic occurrences, reidentifications of occurrences, and three tables describing geological time scales.
Additional scientific tables track ecological and taphonomic attributes of higher taxa and species, measurements of specimens, and data about the digital fossil images on the site.
There are also a number of bookkeeping tables.
The tables are tied together relationally with record ID numbers.
At a later date we may add tables to handle phylogenetic relationships, ecomorphological attributes, stratigraphic sections, radioisotopic age estimates, and other data.
</span>
</p>

<a name="funding"></a>
<p>
<b>How is the Paleobiology Database funded?</b><br>
<span class="small">
The Paleobiology Database's core facility is funded by a grant from the NSF Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology program, and other operations are funded by grants to individual Database members.
The Database originally was funded from 2000 to 2006 by grant from the National Science Foundation's Biocomplexity program.
We are confident of our ability to obtain long-term funding.
</span>
</p>

<a name="organization"></a>
<p>
<b>How is the Database organized?</b><br>
<span class="small">
The Database has a main office at NCEAS that houses <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=personnel">John Alroy</a>, the Database coordinator, and  <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=personnel">Peter Schroeter</a>, the Database software developer and database manager.
Backups of the data are reposited permanently at five different institutions.
The Database includes five <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=working_groups">working groups</a>, several other research groups, and many individual data contributors, and also serves as a repository for the Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems database and Paleogeographic Atlas Project.
General issues are discussed by an Advisory Board that meets once a year and communicates over an e-mail list.
</span>
</p>

<a name="board"></a>
<p>
<b>How is the Advisory Board organized?</b><br>
<span class="small">
Currently, the Board consists of up to 16 members. At least one member is selected from each of the subdisciplines of invertebrate paleontology, invertebrate paleontology, micropaleontology, paleobotany, taphonomy, and vertebrate paleontology. The Database Coordinator is an ex officio member. Most members are Database authorizers, but representatives of other database organizations are included. Each year at least three members are rotated off the Board. Terms are three years long, and members may serve multiple consecutive terms.

<a name="history"></a>
<p>
<b>How did the Database come into existence?</b><br>
<span class="small">
The Paleobiology Database originated in the <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">NCEAS</a>-funded Phanerozoic Marine Paleofaunal Database initiative, which operated from August 1998 through August 2000.
Since then, it has been funded primarily by the National Science Foundation.
You may view the <a href="http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/nceas-web/projects/98ALROY1/proposal.pdf">text of the 1998 NCEAS proposal</a>.
</span>
</p>

<a name="participants"></a>
<p>
<b>Who is currently participating in the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
<span class="small">
Please see our <a href="$exec_url?action=displayAuthorizers">participants</a> web page.
</span>
</p>

<a name="membership"></a>
<p>
<b>Who can join the Paleobiology Database?</b><br>
<span class="small">
Database membership is open to all professional researchers who agree to abide by Database policy and contribute a significant amount of data.
There is no charge for membership or any other service provided by the Database.
Conversely, the Database will not make payments to receive existing data sets.
By "professional," we normally mean trained at a graduate level in paleontology: more than 95% of our contributors have a Ph.D., and the others have master's degrees.
We also expect that contributors will work largely independently of any academic supervisor, as opposed to using data collected by a supervisor.
If you don't fit these criteria but do want to contribute, you might consider entering data under the authorization of a formal Database member who is in your local area.
No formal procedure needs to be followed to become a data enterer.
Please see our <a href="$exec_url?action=displayAuthorizers">list of members</a> for contact information.
If you do wish to join as an independent contributor, please see our <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=join_us">guidelines for joining the Database</a> and then write to <a href="mailto:alroy@nceas.ucsb.edu">the database coordinator</a>.
</span>
</p>

<a name="working_groups"></a>
<p>
<b>What is a Paleobiology Database working group?</b><br>
<span class="small">
The Database organizes "working groups" of database contributors that collaborate on large-scale, long-term research projects.
See our <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=working_groups">working group page</a> for details.
</span>
</p>

<a name="research_groups"></a>
<p>
<b>What is a research group, and how can I form one?</b><br>
<span class="small">
In addition to working groups, the Database also includes less formal research groups.
The purpose of a research group is to facilitate sharing of otherwise private data by researchers who are collaborating on a study.
If you are a contributor, you may form a group or add members to a group at any time, without having to obtain permission from anyone.
Just write the database coordinator stating the name of the group and its members. Conversely, the Database will not add members to your group unless you want us to, even when researchers working in related areas independently join the Database.
</span>
</p>

<a name="ownership"></a>
<p>
<b>Who has access to the data?</b><br>
<span class="small">
We encourage making all contributed data publicly accessible. However, all faunal and floral data sets entered into our system may be protected so that they are not viewable either by any other users (your private data) or by anyone outside of your research group (your group data). Protection is limited for up to two years after date of entry for previously published data, and up to five years for unpublished data.
Your own password will allow you to view research group-readable data belonging to any group that includes you.
Protected data cannot be accessed by any of our scripts or in any other way unless the appropriate password is provided. The only exceptions are the reference search and taxonomy scripts, which need to access all the reference and taxonomy data because there is little subjective interpretation and we need to avoid duplicate entry of published data.
</span>
</p>

<a name="upload"></a>
<p>
<b>Can I upload data into the Database?</b><br>
<span class="small">
We are happy to accept paleontological data files for upload. However, we do have some criteria that must be met first. Specifically, all of the following should be true:
</span>
</p>

<ul>
<li class="tiny"> The contributor already is a PBDB member, or the Advisory Board has approved making the contributor a member after discussing the proposed upload.
<li class="tiny"> The data already are in electronic form.
<li class="tiny"> Entering the data by hand into the PBDB would be extremely time consuming.
<li class="tiny"> The data include most, if not necessarily all, of our key fields (e.g., for a collection record we'd like country, lat/long, period, reference).
<li class="tiny"> A good-faith effort has been made to get the data into PBDB format.
<li class="tiny"> A good-faith effort has been made to identify and remove data that replicate existing PBDB data.
<li class="tiny"> The contributor intends to maintain and augment the data on our system using our software, or else the contributor has no plans to do this on any system.
</ul>
</p>

<span class="small">
<p>Please see our <a href="javascript: tipsPopup('/public/tips/upload_tips.html')">data upload tip sheet</a>.</p>
</span>

<a name="officialPDpublications"></a>
<p>
<b>What is considered an official Paleobiology Database publication?</b><br class="medium">
<span class="small">
We consider any paper to be an official publication if: (a) it uses data taken from the Database; (b) it results from research conducted as part of a Database research group meeting; or (c) it results from research conducted while the author was funded by the Database.
Because we maintain a <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=publications">list</a> of such publications, please notify us as soon as any such paper is accepted for publication and the final version is ready to be sent out.
We will then give the publication a number and add it to the list.
We ask that you acknowledge the Database by adding a line to your paper saying "This is Paleobiology Database publication #..."
</span>
</p>

<a name="electronicPDpublications"></a>
<p>
<b>Are contributed data sets electronic publications?</b><br>
<span class="small">
Yes: contributors may consider their contributed data sets to be electronic publications. We maintain a <a href="$exec_url?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=datasets">web page</a> listing all such data sets. Simply write the database coordinator a letter saying that you consider a certain block of data to be a publication, and then giving a title and list of authors. Of course, electronic publications on this list can refer only to publicly released data.
</span>
</p>

<a name="citations"></a>
<p>
<b>How should the data be cited?</b><br>
<span class="small">
You can cite the Database in either of two ways. First, you can cite the specific electronic publication that you used (see above). Second, you can refer to a specific download from the Paleobiology Database, giving the date and parameters of the download. Here is an example:
</p>
<p>
<i><span class="small">"The data were downloaded from the Paleobiology Database on 31 December, 2000, using the group name 'marine' and the following parameters: time intervals = Carboniferous and Permian, region = Europe, paleoenvironment = marine, class = Bivalvia."</span></i>
</span>
</p>

<a name="oldevents"></a>
<p>
<b>What meetings has the Database held?</b><br>
<span class="small">
Members of Paleobiology Database working groups meet periodically to plan research and data collection, analyze data, and work on manuscripts.
Their past meetings are listed below.
Meetings through August, 2000 were of the original Phanerozoic Marine Paleofaunal Database group.
The Database sponsored the <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=Berlin">International Paleobiology Database Symposium</a> in Berlin in March, 2003.
