<center><h3>Join the Paleobiology Database</h3></center>

<center><h4>Who should join</h4></center>

<p>We encourage all members of the paleontological community to become contributors to the Paleobiology Database ("data authorizers").
Normally, new members have a Ph.D. and want to reposit faunal, floral, or taxonomic data, or images of fossils.
Graduate students may contribute by becoming data enterers working with authorizers at their academic institution or in their local area.
We accept paleontological data of all kinds, including terrestrial, marine, plant, animal, macrofossil, and microfossil data.
We especially urge paleontologists from outside the United States to participate.</p>


<center><h4>Why you should join</h4></center>

<ul>
<li>The Paleobiology Database is an inclusive project, run by and for members of the global paleontological community
<li>Contributors have a say in software design, so we can tailor our systems to your needs
<li>Our systems can accept all the major kinds of paleontological data
<li>Our software has been implemented since 1998 and is heavily debugged
<li>Our fully relational data tables follow communally defined and vetted formats
<li>You can log in to the system and start entering data right away, without having to worry about defining your own data formats and table structure
<li>You can use our analytical software to automatically generate such things as maps, data tables, diversity curves, taxonomic classifications, and synonymy histories
<li>By adding your data to a communal pool, you can perform large-scale analyses that incorporate all the relevant information in a single format, with no duplication
<li>You can download all your data at any time
<li>We back up data nightly on a second server and periodically at five different institutions, so there is no chance of data loss
<li>No-one else other than you can modify your data
<li>If you don't want your data to be visible at first, you can fully protect your data from being seen even by other Database members for up to two years (or five years for your own unpublished data)
<li>Data authorizers may form research groups that communally share otherwise protected data
<li>You can reposit data files such as Excel spread sheets and have them become official Paleobiology Database electronic publications
<li>By becoming involved, e.g., by making your papers official Paleobiology Database publications, you can raise your stature with academic departments and funding agencies
<li>By entering your data you create a permanent record of your work
<li>Once you enter data, no-one ever has to do this footwork again - it's a huge public service
</ul>


<center><h4>How to join</h4></center>

<p>Joining the Database is easy.
If you want to become a data authorizer, simply write an e-mail to the <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=personnel">Database coordinator</a> stating:</p>

<ul>
<li>General information about your academic background
<li>The time interval, geographic area, and taxonomic group you plan to work on
<li>Approximately, the time frame for your research and the amount of data you plan to enter
<li>If your work overlaps with that of another data contributor, the arrangements you have made to coordinate with that person
<li>Your contact information
</ul>

<p>The Database coordinator will then forward your information to our Advisory Board, who will discuss your case.
The coordinator will get back to you with comments and advice offered by the Board.
Once you have been accepted as a new member, you simply need to give the coordinator your preferred password and an account will be set up for you right away.</p>

<p>If you want to become a data enterer, simply contact an authorizer and ask them to have your name added to the list.
No formal procedure needs to be followed.</p>
