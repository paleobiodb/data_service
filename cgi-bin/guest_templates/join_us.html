<center><h3>Join the Paleobiology Database</h3></center>

<center><h4>Who should join</h4></center>

<p>We encourage all members of the paleontological community to become contributors to the Paleobiology Database ("data authorizers").
We accept paleontological data of all kinds, including terrestrial, marine, plant, animal, macrofossil, and microfossil data.
We especially urge paleontologists from outside the United States to participate.</p>

<p>
Normally, new members have a Ph.D. and want to reposit faunal, floral, or taxonomic data, or images of fossils.
Graduate students may contribute by becoming data enterers working with authorizers at their academic institution or in their local area.
Authorizers supervise enterers and set priorities for data collection, and they alone take credit and blame for the data regardless of whether they keystroke the data.</p>

<center><h4>Why you should join</h4></center>

<ul>
<li>The Paleobiology Database is an inclusive project, run by and for members of the global paleontological community
<li>Contributors have a say in software design
<li>Our systems can accept all the major kinds of paleontological data
<li>Our software has been implemented since 1998 and is heavily debugged
<li>Our fully relational data tables follow communally defined and vetted formats
<li>You can log in to the system and start entering data right away, without having to worry about defining your own data formats and table structure
<li>You can use our analytical software to automatically generate such things as maps, data tables, diversity curves, taxonomic classifications, and synonymy histories
<li>By adding your data to a communal pool, you can perform large-scale analyses that incorporate all the relevant information in a single format, with no duplication
<li>You can download all your data at any time
<li>We back up data nightly on a second server and periodically at five different institutions, so there is no chance of data loss
<li>No-one else other than you can modify your data
<li>If you don't want your data to be visible at first, you can fully protect your data from being seen even by other Database members for up to two years (or five years for your own unpublished data)
<li>Data authorizers may form research groups that communally share otherwise protected data
<li>You can reposit data files such as Excel spread sheets and have them become official Paleobiology Database electronic publications
<li>By becoming involved, e.g., by making your papers official Paleobiology Database publications, you can raise your stature with academic departments and funding agencies
<li>By entering your data you create a permanent record of your work
<li>Once you enter data, no-one ever has to do this footwork again - it's a huge public service
</ul>


<center><h4>How to join</h4></center>

<p>Joining the Database is easy.
If you want to become a data authorizer, simply write an e-mail to the <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=personnel">Database coordinator</a> stating:</p>

<ul>
<li>General information about your academic background
<li>The time interval, geographic area, and taxonomic group you plan to work on
<li>The type of data you plan to enter:
  <ul>
  <li>Faunal or floral occurrences, with data on the context of fossil collections
  <li>Taxonomic data such as authority information, synonymies, and classifications
  <li>Taxonomic reidentifications of occurrences entered by yourself or others
  <li>Ecological or taphonomic data about taxa
  <li>Digital images
  </ul>
<li>Approximately, the amount of time you plan to devote to data collection (one afternoon a week, the upcoming summer, etc.)
<li>If your work overlaps with that of another data contributor, the arrangements you have made to coordinate with that person
<li>Your contact information
</ul>

<p>The Database coordinator will then forward your information to our Advisory Board, who will discuss your case.
The coordinator will get back to you with comments and advice offered by the Board.
Once you have been accepted as a new member, you simply need to give the coordinator your preferred password and an account will be set up for you right away.</p>

<p>If you want to become a data enterer and your thesis advisor or colleague is an authorizer, simply ask them to have your name added to the list.
No formal procedure needs to be followed.</p>

<center><h4>For new members</h4></center>

<p>Here is some basic navigational information for new Database members once they have accounts:</p>

<ul>
<li>To enter data, you need to log in. First, click on the "Contributor's area" link at the far right on the public web page's blue navigation bar, or click on "data entry and analysis area" on the entry page.
<li>You need to enter the name of the authorizer and enterer (often the same person) and the password on the login page.
<li>Once you log in you will go to one of two main pages. First, there is a "Main menu" that gives links for data entry, access, and analysis functions. You always can get to this page by clicking on the "Main menu" link on the left side of the blue navigation bar.
<li>Second, there is a "Contributor's home page" page with its own link on the right side of the navigation bar. This page gives links to informational pages of assorted kinds.
<li>Before entering data, you should carefully read the "data entry tutorial," which is linked to the bottom of the main menu.
<li>After or while reading that page, you should read the assorted tip sheets linked to the bottom of the main menu, and then enter test data on the backup server, which is linked to the tutorial.
<li>If you want to log out, click on the "Current enterer" link on the navigation bar.
You can stay logged in indefinitely as long as you continue using the system.
</ul>
