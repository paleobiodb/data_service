<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>
This is a <a href="/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?user=Guest&action=displayPage&page=OSA">Paleobiology Database Online Systematics Archive</a> that includes all known published systematic statements regarding fossil cetaceans. Some accounts of recent cetacean systematics have been entered, but no effort has been made to be comprehensive for recent taxa. This archive also contains every known published occurrence of fossil Cetacea. If any known published account of a fossil cetacean seems to be missing from this archive, please contact the author using the information below, and report the missing occurrence, along with the relevant bibliographic information.
</p>

<h3>Scientific goals</h3>

<p>
This archive aims to compile all information about the identity and distribution of fossil cetacean taxa to facilitate any and all other studies regarding fossil Cetacea. The original goal of this compilation was to study the history of cetacean diversity in the broadest sense. This study is currently in process and will be submitted for publication by the end of 2006. All of the data are publicly available for use by anyone.
</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
Entry of these data began in 2000 and is an ongoing process. New publications on cetacean taxonomy are entered as soon as the author is made aware of them.
