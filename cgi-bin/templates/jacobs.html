Both curves were generated using by-list, occurrences-tallied subsampling ("method 3"). Each curve is based on drawing 400 occurrences within each interval 20 times and averaging the resulting genus counts. The orange line shows results of subsampling from just those lists that each include at least 10 genus occurrences; the purple line shows results of subsampling without such a constraint. The curves are extremely similar (r<font size=-2><sup>2</sup></font> = 0.967).
